<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book tells the stories of some of the baby
mammals of the wilderness,&mdash;how they grow
and learn day by day to take care of themselves.
In hollow trees or down under water among
the lily leaves, in the cool sea or on the rugged
mountains, on the grassy plains or among the
waving tree-tops, in the dark caves and burrows
or hidden in the tangles underfoot,&mdash;all the
world is alive with young creatures.</p>

<p>Bright eyes glitter and small paws patter,
little noses sniff the air and sharp ears twitch.
There is a rustling of leaves above and a crackling
of twigs below, a splashing in the swamp
and a silent bending of the grasses. In the
sunshine or the rain, in the daytime or at night,
life is busy everywhere on this beautiful old
earth.</p>

<p>All the mammals are alike in having hair
on some part of their bodies, in having teeth
at some time in their lives, and in feeding the
young with milk. But there are many, many
kinds of mammals, of different shapes and sizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
and colors. There are all sorts of babies, from
the tiny mouse that could sleep in an eggshell
to the big baby whale, twice as long as an ox.
Some can swim like fishes; others can fly like
birds. Some dig homes under the ground;
others make their nests in hollow trees or caves.
Some live in the mountains and some on the
plains. Some live in the woods and some in
the sea. Some eat grass, and others eat flesh;
some eat nuts, some eat fruit, and some eat
anything they can find.</p>

<p>Many of the mammals are alike in some
ways. Squirrels and mice have strong teeth
to gnaw with; the cow and elk eat grass and
chew a cud, and the bear, wolf, and fox eat
flesh.</p>

<p>Those mammals that are most alike are said
to belong to the same order. For example,
every animal with hoofs belongs to the Order
of Hoofed Mammals. Every animal with four
gnawing teeth in the front of its mouth belongs
to the Order of Gnawing Mammals. Every
animal that lives on flesh belongs to the Order
of Flesh-Eating Mammals.</p>

<p>There are eleven of these groups, but the
animals of North America belong to only eight
of them. All the animals in the first group
have pouches or pockets, of their own skin, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
which to carry the young. The opossum belongs
to this Order of Pouched Mammals.
When he is a baby he is carried around in his
mother&#8217;s  furry pocket. Later he learns to hang
by his feet and tail to a branch while he eats
fruit. At night he trots through the woods
and roots for insects with his pointed nose.</p>

<p>The manatee belongs to the Order of Sea-Cows.
Sea-Cows are fishlike creatures that
eat vegetable food in the sea or in rivers. The
fat baby manatee lies in his mother&#8217;s  arms as
she balances herself on the end of her tail in
the water. He learns to crawl about on the
sandy bottom and munch water-plants.</p>

<p>The whale belongs to the Order of Whales.
Though he lives in the deep ocean and looks
like a monstrous fish, he is really a mammal.
He has warm blood and a few bristles for hair.
The baby whale is fed on milk at first. When
he grows older he is taught to catch and eat
water animals.</p>

<p>The wapiti, called the American elk, belongs
to the Order of Hoofed Four-Foots. They
eat grass and chew the cud. The story of an
elk roaming over the mountains is almost the
same as the story of any of the swift deer
family.</p>

<p>The beaver and the squirrel and the rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
belong to the Order of Gnawers. The beaver
cuts down trees with his strong teeth, and
builds dams and houses of sticks. The squirrel
scampers along the branches, and sits up to
nibble nuts in the shadow of his own bushy
tail. The rabbit scuttles over the ground from
one hiding-place to another, in his daily search
for green grass and tender twigs to eat. Rats
and mice are also Gnawers. Indeed, there are
many more animals in this Order than in any
of the others.</p>

<p>The bear and the wolf and the fox belong
to the Order of Flesh Eaters. They are all
mighty hunters. The swift wolf, the tricky
fox, and the strong-armed bear all have many
long, cutting teeth to tear their prey to pieces.</p>

<p>The mole belongs to the Order of Insect-Eaters.
He lives underground, and learns to
dig with his shovel-like hands. When his
pointed teeth grow out he chases worms up
and down and around, and gobbles them as
fast as he can.</p>

<p>The bats belong to the Order of Wing-Handed
Mammals. The baby bat is rocked
to sleep in his mother&#8217;s  wings. He learns to
fly in the dark and to hunt the swift insects
that hover above the roads and ponds. When
winter is near he finds a gloomy cave. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
he hangs, head downward, by the hooks on
his claws, and sleeps till spring brings the
warm weather again.</p>

<p>It is now countless years since the earth was
new. It has changed from a bare, hot gloomy
ball, covered with black rocks and muddy
water, to a green, beautiful world. There are
all kinds of living things in the ocean. In the
forests insects hum above the flowers; birds
fly from branch to branch; reptiles crawl
beside the rivers. And everywhere&mdash;in the
air and beneath the ground, on the land and
under the water&mdash;live the mammals.</p>

<p>The opossum is the one with a pocket. The
manatee is the only eater of grass in the sea.
The whale is the biggest of all animals. The
elk is the handsomest of the swift deer family.
The beaver is the best builder. The squirrel
has the prettiest tail. The rabbit is the most
hunted by all its hungry enemies. The bear
is the surliest one. The wolf is the fiercest.
The fox is the shrewdest. The mole can dig
better and faster than any of the others.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE ONE WITH A POCKET</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> days and days the new baby opossums
lay crowded close together in their
mother&#8217;s  furry pocket. They slept and
drank milk, and grew and grew till their eyes
began to open. It was dark all around them,
but up above their heads a faint gray line
showed where light was stealing in over the
edge of the pocket.</p>

<p>The biggest baby opossum looked and
looked with his little bright eyes. He wanted
to see more. So up he crawled, clambering
over the soft, tiny bodies of the eleven other
babies. Some of them wriggled and squirmed
under his bare little feet. After slipping back
once or twice he reached the edge and poked
his pointed white snout outside.</p>

<p>He could not see anything because he was
under his mother, and her long fur hung
down over him. She was lying on a nest of
grasses in a hollow tree. That was where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
stayed all day long when the sun was shining
without. Every night at dusk she climbed
down the rough trunk and went to hunt for
something to eat.</p>

<p>When she felt the tiny claws of her baby
clutching her fur she looked down between
her fore-paws at the little mouse-like fellow.
Then with her smooth pink hands she gently
pushed him back into the pocket and closed
the opening. He was not big enough yet to
come out of the warm, dark nursery.</p>

<p>So for a week longer he cuddled down beside
the others, while they all slept and drank
more milk and grew stronger every hour.
The biggest baby was so restless that he
scrambled around and crowded the others.
Once he caught hold of another&#8217;s  tail between
the thumbs and fingers of his hind-feet,
and pulled till the little one squeaked.
His fore-feet were like tiny hands without any
thumbs.</p>

<p>At last, one day, he saw the edge of the
pocket open a crack. He was so glad that
he climbed up as fast as he could scramble,
and pushed outside. He held on to his
mother&#8217;s fur with all four feet. When she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>reached down to smell him the bristles on her
lips tickled his nose. Then he climbed around
upon her back and twisted his tail about hers
to hold him steady.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i019.jpg" alt="The Opossum" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Opossum.</span><br />

&#8220;In a few minutes another and another baby followed the big brother and clung
there on the mother&#8217;s  furry back.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 5.</p>

<p>He looked like a mouse, with his long tail,
his black ears erect, his bright eyes twinkling
in his little white face, and his pointed nose
sniffing at the strange odors in the hollow
tree. It was much lighter there than inside
the pocket. Higher up over his head there
was a hole leading out of the hollow. Queer
small shadows were dancing and flickering
across the opening. He did not know that
they were only green leaves.</p>

<p>In a few minutes another and another baby
followed the big brother and clung there on
the mother&#8217;s  furry back. It must have seemed
a noisy place to them, for while in the pocket
they had noticed only the softest muffled rustling
and scratching of the old one&#8217;s  feet in
the nest. Now they could hear a chirping and
a squeaking and a rattling of branches. They
crowded close together in fright at the scream
of a blue jay, as it chased a chattering red
squirrel through the tree-top. Then a sudden
loud thump-thump-thump of a woodpecker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
hammering on the bark outside sent them
scuttling back to the safe nursery in a tumbling
hurry.</p>

<p>After this the whole family climbed out
every day to play about on the mother&#8217;s  back.
The biggest baby liked to curl his small tail
about her large one, and then swing off head
downward. Sometimes he pushed the others
down just for the fun of seeing them scramble
up again, hand over hand, clutching the long
fur.</p>

<p>Of course he was the first one to poke his
head out every day. Once he woke from a
nap in the pocket and started to climb outside.
But he stopped half-way, hanging to
the edge with both fore-feet. It was nearly
evening, and the old mother opossum was
clambering down the trunk to go hunting for
her supper.</p>

<p>The baby held on tightly, while she trotted
away through the woods. Now and then a
leaf rustled or a stick cracked under her feet.
Sleepy birds were twittering in their nests.
The mother pricked her ears and listened, for
she ate eggs and young birds whenever she
could find them within reach. She had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
tasted an egg this spring, because she could
not climb very nimbly with her pocket full of
babies.</p>

<p>Presently she came to a swamp, and splash,
splash, splash! the mud went flying. It spattered
the baby&#8217;s  white face and made him
sputter and cough. Then he heard the dreadful
croaking of hundreds of frogs. In a terrible
fright he slid back into the nursery to
hide beside the others.</p>

<p>The old one was trying to catch a frog to
eat. Now she jumped this way, and now she
jumped that way. Such a jostling as the
babies felt when she finally gave a great
spring for a big green fellow sitting on a
log. She caught him, too, but the jolt almost
knocked the breath out of the twelve soft
little bodies in her pocket.</p>

<p>On another evening the babies awoke to
find themselves swinging to and fro in dizzying
jerks. They rolled and tumbled from side
to side. They bumped their heads and noses
against one another. When the biggest baby
tried to push his way out he found the edge
of the pocket close shut. Though he scratched
and squeaked the mother did not open it. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
was afraid that they would all fall to the
ground, for there she was hanging upside-down
by her tail to a branch of the tree.</p>

<p>Down below on the ground a big black bear
was hugging the trunk and shaking it as hard
as he could. He was trying to shake the old
opossum off so that he might catch her and
eat the whole family. But she held on so long
that finally he became tired of waiting. So
away he walked to find something else for
supper. Then the mother swung down to the
nest in the hollow and rested there while her
babies played around her.</p>

<p>Every day the babies stayed outside the
nursery for a longer time, though they were
always ready to scurry back at the mother&#8217;s
first warning grunt. They kept growing bigger,
till one night they found that they could
not all crowd into the pocket. Then they
huddled together on her back, with their tails
twisted around hers.</p>

<p>In this way they rode through the woods
when she went hunting. They watched with
their bright eyes while she turned over rotting
logs with her snout to catch the grubs underneath.
Sometimes she rooted in the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
for sprouting acorns, or nipped off mouthfuls
of tender grass. Once she caught a young
rabbit. Then how excited the little opossums
were! And how they all squeaked and hissed
together as they rode trotting home!</p>

<p>By this time they had cut their teeth,&mdash;fifty
sharp little teeth in each hungry mouth. It
was time for them to be weaned. When they
tried to drink milk the mother pushed them
away. Then she picked some sweet red berries,
and taught the hungry babies how to eat
them. They learned to chew the juicy roots
that she dug in the fields.</p>

<p>The babies were greedy little things. When
the old one caught a mouse or a mole or a
toad, the young ones all rushed and snatched.
Once the biggest baby gobbled up a beetle
before the others could get a taste. They
were so angry that they tried to bite his nose
and ears. He squeaked, and ran as fast as
he could to hide under the mother.</p>

<p>She was a good and patient mother. Of
course, as long as they were small enough to
stay in her pocket she carried them everywhere
with her. Even when they grew as
large as rats they rode on her back through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the woods. These twelve fat babies were so
heavy that sometimes she staggered and
stumbled under the load.</p>

<p>One night, when all the babies were trotting
along on their own feet, they saw two
gleaming red eyes in the dark thicket before
them. Something round and furry snarled
and sprang at them. They all ran under
their mother as quick as a wink. She ruffled
her long grayish hair above them. When the
animal jumped at her she growled and hissed
and scratched and bit furiously, till he ran
limping away into the shadowy wilderness.</p>

<p>On another evening a big dog came galloping
up before they could scramble into a tree.
His red tongue was hanging out of his mouth
between his white teeth. As soon as he caught
sight of the opossums he made a dash to catch
them. Instantly they all fell down and rolled
over, just as if they were dead.</p>

<p>There they lay, with their eyes shut, their
paws limber, their tails limp. They seemed to
stop breathing. The dog smelled them and
pushed them with his cold nose. But they
kept perfectly still and did not move even
an eyelash. They were pretending to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
dead. It was the one trick that they all
knew without being taught.</p>

<p>The minute the dog walked away up they
all jumped and scampered into a tree as fast
as they could scurry. When the dog turned
his head and saw them he ran back and
leaped up to reach them. But all the opossums
were safe enough now. While he was
jumping and barking below they clung fast
in the tree with their hand-like feet. They
wound their tails about the branches above to
hold more securely.</p>

<p>The little opossums learned to climb all sorts
of trees, rough or smooth. It was easier to
climb the rough trees because they could dig
their nails farther into the bark. The biggest
baby could walk along the springiest limb, even
if it kept teetering up and down in the wind.
When he felt like it he swung by his tail for
the longest time without getting dizzy.</p>

<p>All summer long the twelve little opossums
stayed with their mother. During the day
they slept cuddled in the hollow tree. The old
father opossum never came home, for the
mother had driven him away before the babies
were born. She wanted all the room in the nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for them. She could take care of them better
than he could, because she was bigger and knew
how to fight her enemies more fiercely. Every
night, after sunset, the mother and her twelve
children set off on their hunting. Down
through the woods to the marsh they trotted.
There some waded into the mud to catch frogs,
while others chased mud-turtles over the shore.
Some hunted for berries and others nosed for
acorns under the oaks.</p>

<p>It was beautiful there in the woods at night.
When the stars twinkled overhead and the soft
wind rustled in the tree-tops the little ones
frisked and frolicked. They hid under the
shadowy bushes or jumped hither and thither
to snap at the fluttering moths. But on stormy
evenings they plodded on in the rain, their
wet fur drooping. With their noses close to
the ground they hunted till they found a few
mouthfuls to eat. Then back to the cosy hollow
for a longer nap, after licking their pink
hands clean and washing their white faces,
just as kittens do.</p>

<p>One night, in autumn, the old mother opossum
felt the nip of frost in the air. Then she
knew that the persimmons were ready to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
eaten. Away through the woods she hurried,
with the young ones trotting after her. Past
the marsh and over the blackberry hills she
led the way to a thicket of trees tangled with
wild grapevines. There above on the branches
the round little persimmons were shining yellow
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Up the trees eleven of the babies scrambled
hungrily, and, hanging by their tails, stuffed
the fruit into their wide mouths. Ah! but
wasn&#8217;t  it delicious! Better than anything they
had ever tasted before in all their short lives!
Then the biggest baby, who had stopped to
gobble ripe grapes, heard them munching so
greedily. One look sent him clambering after
the others. He was sorry enough that he had
wasted any time eating wild grapes.</p>

<p>Night after night, till the persimmons were
gone, the opossums hurried away to the thicket,
and ate and ate till they could eat no longer.
They grew so fat that they puffed and panted
when trotting home again in the gray light of
frosty dawn.</p>

<p>As the weather grew colder the opossums
roamed farther through the woods in search
of food. Once in a while one of them found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
a pawpaw-tree. Then from far and near opossums
gathered under the low wide-spreading
branches to feast on the banana-shaped fruit.
That was the last good dinner that the little
fellows had for many weeks.</p>

<p>Soon the ground was frozen hard over the
juicy roots. All the fruit left in the woods
hung wrinkled and frost-bitten. The worms
and toads crawled into their holes for the
winter. The beetles disappeared, and the
spiders curled up in their hiding-places to
sleep through the cold weather. Most of the
birds flew away south.</p>

<p>One by one each little opossum wandered
off by himself, and made a nest in a cosy hole
or a snug hollow stump. There he drowsed
away the days, and often slept through the
nights without stirring out. Now and then
one of them caught a mouse or dug up a frozen
root to nibble. Sometimes they tore rotten
logs apart to get at the torpid grubs within.
The biggest baby found a heap of nuts hidden
away under a stone by a thrifty chipmunk.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the winter the little
opossums were so fat that they could live three
or four weeks without eating or drinking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
When the cold winds blew, and the snow fell
silently, they cuddled down in their warm nests
and slept the time away. But many a night
they woke up hungry. And every day their
round furry bodies were a little thinner, till at
last spring melted the snow and ice everywhere.</p>

<p>There was plenty to eat by that time, with
all the green things growing. The little creatures
of the woods and ponds were waking to
new life. There were buds to nibble and
beetles to catch. There was many a nest of
birds&#8217; eggs, too, and broods of tender young
field-mice squeaking in the grass. There were
frogs croaking in the marsh, and berries were
ripening in the fields.</p>

<p>The twelve little opossums were grown up
now, and knew how to take care of themselves.
Their mother had another family of babies in
her furry pocket. Sometimes she met her other
children roaming beside the marsh to catch
frogs. One evening they saw, just as plain
as anything, a little pointed nose and two
twinkling bright eyes peeping over the edge
of her pocket.</p>

THE SEA</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i035.jpg" alt="The Manatee" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Manatee.</span><br />
&#8220;The old mother manatee held him close to her.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 19.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Down</span> among the lily-leaves, under the
river, the baby manatee was being
rocked to sleep on his mother&#8217;s  breast.
He looked like a roly-poly fish, with a puffy
dog-face. He was covered all over from his
broad tail to his round head with thick and
wrinkly gray skin. His tiny eyes were shut,
and his flippers were folded together as he
slept.</p>

<p>The old mother manatee held him close to
her, bending her short flippers, which were
really her arms. The fingers at the ends
of her hands were so hidden under the skin
that they looked as if covered with mittens.
She was balancing herself on the end of her
tail, and swaying gently to and fro in the
water.</p>

<p>The baby&#8217;s  nap did not last very long. One
of the annoying things about being a manatee
and living under water was the trouble
in breathing. Every two or three minutes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
mother flapped her tail and rose to the top
of the river to breathe. That always woke the
baby. He opened his eyes, blinking in the
bright sunlight.</p>

<p>All around him the water sparkled and
dimpled in the sunshine. Here and there
dragon-flies glittered as they skimmed over
the ripples. Butterflies were fluttering over
the golden centres of the floating lilies.
Graceful reeds bordered the shore. The
juicy grass, that manatees love to eat, grew
green, trailing underneath. Far up above it
all the summer sky was blue.</p>

<p>The baby manatee did not seem to care for
all these beautiful sights. Very likely he could
not see well above water, and he did not enjoy
the dry, warm feeling of the air. His sense
of smell must have been too dull to notice the
fragrance of the lilies or the spicy scent from
the swamp. Creatures living under water do
not use their noses much.</p>

<p>But the little manatee could hear the least
soft plop of a leaf falling in the river. The
sudden splash of a frog&#8217;s  jump made him
squirm and twist in terror. He wriggled out
of his mother&#8217;s  hold, and sank down, down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
down, with the bubbles eddying over his roly-poly
body.</p>

<p>Of course he was not afraid, for he could
swim as soon as he was born. He paddled
with his tail and flapped with his flippers as
he went swimming around over the clean
white sand of the river-bottom. At first he
could not steer very well, and so he bumped
into the stems of the lily-plants and tangled
his flippers among the roots of the reeds.</p>

<p>Through the pale green of the water all
around him he caught sight of his father and
big brother. They were creeping about on
their flippers and tails, while they munched the
weeds and grasses. When they stretched out
their heads, toward a bite of something, each
one grasped the food between two horny pads
in the front of his jaw, tore it free, and then
chewed it with his few grinding teeth in the
back. Their faces looked like monstrous caterpillars
sucking and chewing.</p>

<p>The baby champed his small jaws and
sucked with his split upper lip as he watched.
The sight of them eating made him so hungry
that he wanted his mother to come and feed
him with her milk. Manatees are mammals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that live in shallow water. Of all the animals
in the sea and salt rivers manatees are the
only ones that eat only grass and weeds. All
other sea-mammals, and fishes, too, eat living
creatures.</p>

<p>Sometimes the baby manatee had great fun
in rolling over and over on the sand and pebbles
at the bottom of the river. The old ones
liked to scratch and clean their wrinkled skins
by plunging and scraping over the gravel. It
was easy enough for them to roll, because they
were so round and had no legs to get in the
way.</p>

<p>After the tumbling he followed the others
as they went paddling to the top of the river.
There he twitched apart his lip-lobes and blew,
spouting up spray and water. Then, drawing
in a long breath, he closed the stoppers in his
nostrils and floated down to the sandy bottom
to sleep or eat again.</p>

<p>All summer the manatees lived there in the
pleasant river. On misty mornings sometimes
they swam up to a mud flat, and crawled out
to take a nap in the soft warm slime. Out
in the air they could sleep and breathe at the
same time, without waking up every few min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>utes.
When the baby was tired of staying still
he slid down the slippery bank&mdash;splash!&mdash;into
the water.</p>

<p>His splashing sent a snake wriggling away
through the swamp. The crabs on the sand
below went scuttling wildly hither and thither
to escape the flapping of his tail. Fishes
darted out-stream, and mussels closed their
shells to keep out the stirred-up gravel. The
frogs sitting in the mud turned their round
eyes to look at the funny little fellow with the
wrinkled dark skin.</p>

<p>Away he paddled to the bottom and tried
to munch the water-grasses. His few teeth
were cutting through his gums by this time,
and he was hungry for something besides
milk. The green leaves tasted so salty and
stringy that he did not like them at first. It
was easier to suck warm, rich milk, without
needing to chew and chew till his jaws really
ached.</p>

<p>One night the manatees lay down on the
clean sand, folded their flippers under them,
and closed their eyes. They fell fast asleep.
Now one and now another woke to swim to
the top for a good long breath. About mid-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>night
the old mother suddenly felt a chill
stealing through the water. She shivered all
over, and hurried to wake the others. She
knew that cold weather had come. If they
did not take care they would all catch cold
and die.</p>

<p>So away they started, as fast as they could
paddle, down the river to the sea. Then south
along the shore they travelled to find warmer
waters. They kept so near land that they
could hear the waves breaking on the beach.
The ocean washed to and fro in swinging billows
over their heads. When the baby lifted
his head above the surface, bits of foam blew
in his eyes from the curling crests of the waves.</p>

<p>Down below, where the old ones stopped to
munch the seaweeds, he saw wonderful things.
There were starfish crawling along with their
five rays spread out. There were transparent
jellyfishes, with long threads streaming down
from their quivering bodies. There were mussels
in their hinged shells lying on the bottom.
There were sponges growing on the rocks.
There were trees of branching coral, each tiny
coral animal waving the fringe around its
open mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course there were fishes&mdash;hundreds
and hundreds of them&mdash;flashing everywhere.
Once a fat porpoise came rolling and tumbling
through the shallow water. He was a
mammal, and belonged to the same group as
the whales. When he was a baby he fed on
milk, just in the same way as the little manatee
and all other mammals.</p>

<p>On and on travelled the manatees toward
the warm south seas, now swimming on
swiftly, now stopping to munch the weeds.
Sometimes they stood on the tips of their
tails and nodded their heads as if bowing.
Sometimes they folded their flippers under
them to sleep, then woke to breathe, and fall
asleep again.</p>

<p>After days and days they reached the
southern river, where they were to spend the
winter. There they found another family of
manatees with a little one just the size of the
baby. While the old ones munched the weeds,
or dozed on the mud islands, the two youngest
slid down the slippery banks and splashed and
dived together. They took naps side by side.
Sometimes they tried to balance themselves on
their tails, as the old ones did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>This southern river was different from
that one at home. The plants had broader
leaves and larger flowers. The swamp was
tangled and shadowy even at noonday.
Strange animals tramped through the underbrush;
monkeys swung on the branches, and
brightly-colored birds flew overhead. Hairy
spiders crawled over the ground, and big
snakes wriggled into the water.</p>

<p>When spring came, away the manatees
swam on their way back to the pleasant river,
where the baby first opened his little eyes in
the cool green nursery among the lily-leaves.
Of course he never knew that some sailors
once saw his mother rocking him to sleep at
the top of the water. They thought that she
was a mermaid with a baby in her arms.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE BIGGEST ONE</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">He</span> was the very biggest baby in all the
world. He looked like a monstrous
fish as he lay beside his mother in the
middle of the bay. But he was not a fish.
He breathed with lungs instead of gills. On
his thick skin he had a few bristly hairs instead
of scales such as fishes have. The blood
rushing through the great veins in his body
was warm instead of cold. And finally he
was drinking milk in mighty gulps that sent
gallons and gallons down his baby throat at
every swallow. He was a whale, and belonged
to the class of mammals.</p>

<p>The big body of the mother whale looked
like a dark rounded island as she lay on her
side almost out of water. She was the largest
mother animal that ever lived. When she
opened her enormous jaws her mouth seemed
like a gloomy cave. Fastened along its floor
was an immense cushiony white tongue as big
as a feather-bed.</p>

<p>The baby whale himself was twice as long
as an ox. His smooth skin glistened like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
shiny leather when he heaved his back above
the waves for an instant. Once in a while he
flapped his forked tail or wriggled his front
fins. Though his eyes were bigger than a
cow&#8217;s  they looked very small while he lay,
half asleep, rocking lazily to and fro in the
swell of the sea.</p>

<p>The baby whale knew how to swim alone
from the very first day. The earliest thing he
remembered was the water lapping over his
eyes and tickling in the tiny holes of his ears.
On top of his head there were two blow-holes,
or nostrils, closed with valves, to keep the water
from trickling into his lungs.</p>

<p>When he rose to the top of the sea, to
fill his lungs with air, away he swam, up
and up, easily and lightly, through the pale-green
water, toward the sunlight twinkling
on the surface above. The mother whale
swam beside him, almost touching him with
her flippers. Her flippers were really her
arms. When he was tired she helped him
by holding him up.</p>

<p>As soon as his head pushed above the waves
he opened the valves in the blow-holes and
drew great breaths of sweet, fresh air deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
down into his lungs. How good it felt!
Then arching his back, with a flourish of
his tail down he dived after his mother.
They sank swiftly into the cool depths, while
the sea closed silently over their shining
sides.</p>

<p>The baby whale did not go down very far.
The air in his lungs buoyed him up. His
bones were light and full of oil. Under his
dark skin a layer of fat, called blubber, kept
him floating, almost as if he were wearing a
life-preserver wrapped around him.</p>

<p>The new air in his lungs grew warm and
damp. After a few minutes he wanted to
breathe again. So with a flap-flap-flap of his
tail up he paddled. Puff, piff! out through
the blow-holes rushed the warm air from his
lungs. In the cold outside air it changed to
spray, and went spouting up like a fountain.
Down it came showering, with silver drops
splashing and tinkling.</p>

<p>That must have been fun. The baby could
not stay under water so long as his mother
could. Often he left her swimming around
over the rocky bottom of the bay while he
paddled up to get a fresh breath. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
he was in such a hurry that he blew out before
reaching the top. Then the water above
him went spouting up, and sprinkling back
noisily about his glistening head.</p>

<p>For days and days the baby whale lived
there in the bay with his mother. It was the
whole world to him, for he had seen no other
place. Of course he did not know how it
looked from above, with its blue, sparkling
water, and its tall cliffs casting long shadows
over the ripples at dawn.</p>

<p>To him the bay was a delightful playground.
Its oozy floor was covered with
rocks under the cool green water. Long
fringes of seaweed floated deep down under
there. In dark caves sponges and sea-lilies
grew, and crabs scuttled backward into slimy
crannies. There were big fishes and little
fishes darting to and fro. At times they hung
motionless, with glistening scales, their round
eyes unwinking, their tails quivering now and
then.</p>

<p>Every day, after the baby whale drank all
the milk he wanted, he took a nap, lying beside
his mother on the surface of the bay.
Every day he grew a little bigger, and swam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
a little faster, and stayed below a little longer
without rising to breathe.</p>

<p>When he was old enough to stop drinking
milk he learned to eat the food which
his mother liked. He often watched her
swimming around the bay, with her great
mouth hanging open. There were millions
of the tiniest kind of creatures living in
the water. They flowed into her mouth at
the same time with the water. When she
felt them tickling and wiggling over her
tongue she closed her jaw almost shut. A
sieve of long elastic strips of bone fell like
a curtain from the roof of her mouth. Then
the water drained out between the strips of
bone, leaving the tiny animals inside to be
swallowed.</p>

<p>Instead of teeth the baby whale found such
a fringe of whalebone strips growing on the
roof of his mouth. When it was long enough
to use he began to swim around with his jaw
hanging down. Every day, in this way, he
caught and ate thousands of tiny shrimps and
crabs and mussels. He could not swallow any
large fish because his throat was only a few
inches wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not know that there are different
whales in a different part of the sea. These
other whales have teeth instead of whalebone
sieves. In the tops of their heads they have
great holes filled with sperm oil. Their throats
are wide enough to swallow a man. They are
called sperm whales, but the whales with whalebone
strips in their mouths are called true
whales.</p>

<p>When the baby stopped drinking milk the
mother set out with him to leave the bay, and
find the father whale in the deep sea without.
The young whale could swim almost as fast
as the old one now. He could stay under
water without breathing quite as long as she
could. The warm blanket of blubber under
his skin had grown thicker. It kept him
warm and helped him to float.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was afraid to leave the safe bay
for the wide ocean. He kept close beside his
mother as they went rushing on, with their
tails slapping up and down and around. The
tail sent each one ahead, just as the screw of
a steamer drives it forward. With their flippers
they steadied their round bodies so that
they would not roll over and over like logs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Out between the rocky cliffs, at the mouth
of the inlet, they rushed through the green
water. After travelling some distance out to
sea the baby noticed that the water looked
black below them, reaching down and down
and down. He could not see the oozy, shell-covered
floor, as in the bay. Above him the
waves were larger, and swayed to and fro,
cresting in foam. The big fishes were darting
hither and thither before the great round,
rushing bodies of the mother and the baby
whale.</p>

<p>Very likely the old whale had been lonesome
in the bay. She swam on in a hurry to find
her mate and the rest of the herd. The baby
followed as hard as he could paddle. This
was a wonderful new world to him. Probably
he wanted to stop and look around, especially
when he rose to breathe. Once he gave a
mighty jump and shot out far above the
waves. He could not see well, except directly
behind him. But while above there in the air
he twisted in a curving leap. Everywhere water,
water, water, stretching on and on and on.</p>

<p>He could not see a single sign of any other
whales being near. Yet somehow or other the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
old mother knew that they were not far away.
It may be that she could hear through the
water, as if telephone-wires were spread under
the waves. Sure enough! soon the baby heard
the splashing of heavy bodies turning over
and over in slow rolling. When he rose to
breathe he caught sight of spouting fountains,
where the other whales were blowing in the
sea.</p>

<p>When the strangers came swimming toward
him he hung back behind his mother. They
glided about him, now and then touching him
with their fins, noses, or tails. They twisted
around so as to see him with their dull little
eyes. Then they went on with their eating
and lazy rolling on the surface of the
sea.</p>

<p>The baby and his mother belonged to the
herd now. It was time for them all to start
north to colder waters, as summer was near.
Food was growing scarce in that part of the
ocean. When the whales stayed too long in
one place barnacles and limpets fastened on
the huge bodies, and made them uncomfortable.
One day the baby felt a tickling barnacle
on his throat. He scratched so hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
against a jagged rock that he tore a rent
a foot long in the blubber. But it did
not hurt much, and in a few days it was
healed.</p>

<p>There were a number of other young whales
in the herd. The biggest old father whale took
the lead while the rest followed, on and on,
moving through the sea all day long. Sometimes
they stopped to swim around and around
with their mouths hanging open. The tiny
crabs and other animals flowed in upon the
great satiny white tongues. Sometimes they
all took pleasant naps while floating on the
surface. Once a sea-bird flew down and
pecked at a barnacle on the baby&#8217;s  head.</p>

<p>At night the herd lay still, sleeping beneath
the stars. All around them the ocean glimmered
and twinkled. The ripples shone with
fiery light. Now and then one or another big
whale blew out his warm breath slowly and
drowsily, his great sides heaving in a tremendous
sigh. Then, when the morning came,
and the sky grew bright at the horizon, they
woke and plunged below for breakfast. They
did not even look at the beautiful colors in
the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly every day the young ones had a race.
Off and away! their bodies bending like bows,
their broad tails churning the water into foaming
waves behind them. Many a time the baby
dived down, down, down, till the water looked
black around him. Then, when he was almost
smothering under the heavy weight of the sea,
he turned in a hurry, and went rushing up
with a bound and a puff. He shot out into
the sunshine with a mighty leap. What a tremendous
splashing he made as he fell back on
his side, while all the other baby whales slapped
the water with their tails under the shower of
spray!</p>

<p>One morning he had a terrible fright. It
happened that he lagged behind the herd to
catch one more mouthful of breakfast. When
at last he was ready to follow the rest he saw
three strange animals hurrying after him.
They were almost as big as he was, and they
had fierce little eyes and sharp white teeth.
He was so afraid that he swam as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>They were really a kind of small whale that
eats the tongues of large whales. They were
called killers. All three raced after the baby.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>One caught hold of his lip and tried to
drag his mouth open. The other two pulled
and bit at the other side of the poor
frightened fellow. Just as they had his
mouth almost open, and were snapping like
wolves at sight of his tongue, they heard the
old mother whale come tearing back to the
rescue.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i057.jpg" alt="The Whale" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Whale.</span><br />

&#8220;The old mother whale came tearing back to the rescue.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 39.</p>

<p>Before they had time to dart away she
dived head foremost. Raising her great tail
she swept it around and around, churning the
water into foam. One dreadful blow crushed
a killer, and the others rushed away. Seizing
the trembling baby between her flippers and
neck the mother hurried on to catch up with
the herd again.</p>

<p>This was excitement enough for one day.
Indeed, it was the greatest adventure of the
year, except for the narrow escape from the
ice-floe. This last adventure happened when
the herd was just leaving the north to swim
south again. The baby whale was quite a big
fellow by this time. By some accident he
found himself shut into a bay by a floating
mass of ice.</p>

<p>The ice-floe covered the water and was driv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>ing
closer and closer to the shore. The young
whale swam ahead of it till he was almost on
the beach. Still it kept pressing nearer and
nearer. Again and again he tried to swim
under it, but he could not hold his breath long
enough to get through to the open sea. If
he could not breathe he would drown, just like
any other mammal.</p>

<p>Finally, just as the ice was rubbing against
the big black sides, he raised himself high in
the air and threw his heavy body with a crash
down on the floe. Luckily, he happened to
strike a thin place. The immense cake of
ice cracked and split. The whale gave a
plunge and broke his way through to safety.
He was glad enough to find the herd again
and swim on with them toward the southern
waters.</p>

<p>So down along the shore the huge beasts
went frolicking together. They leaped out of
the sea, turning summersaults and tumbling
over and over. They patted one another with
such resounding smacks of their flippers that
the noise was like thunder. Now they darted
ahead, leaving a wake of dancing foam; now
they dived, arching their backs, and flirting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
their tails high in the air. And through the
quiet nights they lay with the waves lapping
softly against them, with the starlight glistening
upon the great black bodies rolling in the
swell.</p>

<p class="ph2">ONE OF THE FLEETEST</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the most interesting thing! The
big brother elk, who was just a year old,
peered in through the branches, his ears
pointed forward. His great soft eyes were
shining, and his nostrils were quivering with
excitement. There, on a bed of leaves in the
mountain-thicket, lay a new little baby elk.</p>

<p>He looked like the big brother, except for
the white spots on his satiny brown coat. With
his slender legs doubled under him he lay perfectly
still, not even twitching his ears, as old
deer to catch the slightest sound. He was
looking up at his big brown mother standing
beside him.</p>

<p>The brother elk edged nearer and nearer,
till a branch crackled under his hoofs. Instantly
the old mother raised her head and
pricked her ears in the direction of the sound.
When she caught sight of the brother she
drew back her lips from her teeth and squealed
angrily. Her eyes gleamed. She began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
walk toward him, squealing and shaking her
head to drive him away. He was so surprised
that he snorted out loud. Then backing off,
first one foot and then the other, he hid among
some trees close by.</p>

<p>He must have felt very lonesome as he
waited there by himself on the mountain.
He listened to every rustle of a leaf or
crackle of a twig in the thicket where the
baby was lying. Before this his mother had
always been kind to him. He did not know
why she drove him away,&mdash;when he was not
doing any harm. The reason was because
every little noise made her nervous. She was
afraid wolves or panthers might come prowling
around there, where the baby lay helpless
on the leaves.</p>

<p>After a few days the baby scrambled to his
feet and went staggering a bit unsteadily
after his mother as she led the way out from
the thicket. The big brother came timidly
up to them. He smelled the little one very
gently, nosing all over his soft dappled body.
The mother did not pay much attention, and
the baby was not afraid. He stood quite still,
looking around with his shining eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a beautiful world in May. All
around him there were groves of aspens
twinkling their silvery leaves in the early
sunlight. Farther up the mountain-side dark
evergreens grew thick among the rocks.
Down the valley a brook splashed and gurgled
over stones on its way to a lake lying
in the cool shadow of the pines.</p>

<p>Very likely, although the baby elk could see
well enough, he cared more for the things
which he could smell. There was such a delicious
fragrance everywhere of spicy evergreens
and the damp sweet breath of mosses
and blossoming flowers. Of course he was
too young to taste the juicy grasses and tender
twigs, but he surely enjoyed the tempting odor
of it all. The world smelled very good to eat.</p>

<p>Like all little mammals he drank milk till
his teeth cut through his gums later in the
year. Like the buffaloes the older elk had
horny pads instead of teeth in the front of
their upper jaws. They tore off a mouthful
of grass or leaves with a jerk of the head
and swallowed it half chewed. Then, during
the heat of the day, when they were lying
down to rest in the shade, or standing in pools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of water, they drew up the fodder from their
stomachs and chewed it again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i069.jpg" alt="The Elk" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Elk.</span><br />

&#8220;Grazing over the upland meadows.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 48.</p>

<p>All summer long the little elk lived in the
mountains with his mother and brother. At
night he slept nestled close to them in some
safe thicket. In the daytime he trotted beside
them as they roamed grazing over the upland
meadows and along the brooks. Though they
were fond of feeding near the water they did
not care so much as some other kinds of deer
to eat lily-leaves.</p>

<p>In the early part of the summer the mother
and brother looked very ragged. Their thick
winter coat began to fall out. It was so
matted that it clung to the body like a torn
blanket. Every time they rubbed against a
bush or thorny tree their old hair was torn
in long strips and tatters. When at last it
had all been rubbed off their fresh short,
summer fur shone out bright and glistening
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Little by little the white spots on the baby&#8217;s
coat were fading. By the end of August he
was all in plain brown like the older ones,
with only a patch of white around his tail.
Probably he did not notice the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
himself because he could not turn his head
far enough to see many of the spots on his
sides and neck.</p>

<p>Indeed he was astonished enough one day,
while still in the spotted coat, to see another
little spotted elk come timidly out of a thicket
of aspens. At first both babies stood still,
with their ears pricked forward and their big
soft eyes wide open. Then the first one
bravely walked up to the other and smelled
him all over. After that they were friends
and played together. They could both say
ba-a-a, and drink milk, and gallop over the
grass, with their little hoofs kicking out
behind.</p>

<p>The next day another mother elk with a
baby and a big brother joined the band.
Then another family came, and another, till
there were dozens and dozens of them all together.
Such scampering frolics as the little
ones enjoyed! While the old mothers were
quietly grazing over the steep slopes the
babies raced from one rock to another. Each
one tried to push up first to the highest point,
and then stand there, looking down at the
others. Once the roughest little fellow butted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
another off a high rock and almost broke his
leg.</p>

<p>When a baby butted with his round little
head it did not hurt much. But the big
brothers all had sharp antlers sprouting from
their foreheads. In the spring the knobs
above their eyes had begun to swell and grow
out into bony spikes covered with a velvety
network of skin and veins. These antlers
were different from the horns worn by the
buffaloes. Every buffalo had a pair of horns
that lasted all his life. The mother buffaloes
had horns, but the mother elk did not have
antlers. The antlers were solid bone instead
of hollow like the horns. Each of the father
elks and the big brothers had a new pair
every spring to replace the old pair that
dropped off during the winter.</p>

<p>By mid-summer the antlers stopped growing.
Then the big brothers in the band
pounded and rubbed their antlers against
bushes and young trees, so as to strip off the
velvety covering. When they had sham fights
they could butt hard enough to hurt. They
bumped their heads together, and pushed with
all their might to see which was the strongest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Autumn was not far off now, and the band
of mother elk and young ones began to move
down from the mountains to the foot-hills.
In winter the snow lay so deep in the high
valleys that they could not walk far or find
enough to eat. Farther and farther down
they wandered every day. The babies were
learning to eat grass like the older ones.</p>

<p>One morning the smallest baby elk was
picking his steps along the edge of a cliff.
He halted and raised his pretty head to look
far up the canyon before him. There, away
off against the pine-woods on the mountain-side,
he caught sight of a spot of brown
moving toward him. Nearer and nearer it
came, till he saw that it was an animal even
bigger than his mother. It was an old father
elk coming down from his summer retreat in
the highest gorges.</p>

<p>In all his short life the baby had never seen
such a stately and beautiful creature. His
mother was not nearly so large as this elk,
and she wore no antlers at all. The big
brother&#8217;s  antlers were only short spikes without
any prongs. On strode the newcomer,
leaping over fallen trees and wading through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the brooks to join the band. His long black
mane was waving on his neck; his nostrils were
quivering; his great eyes were flashing; his
splendid antlers rose, branching high above his
graceful head.</p>

<p>The fine stranger stalked among the others
and smelled them, in their way of getting acquainted.
Then he began to feed with them
all. The mother elk and little ones followed
meekly when he started to lead the band down
the mountain. He did not pay much attention
to the babies. Sometimes he pushed them out
of his way, or drove them hither and thither,
as he pleased. He was a selfish old fellow and
never thought of taking care of the others.
Whenever he found a delicious tuft of juicy
grass he hurried to munch it all by himself.</p>

<p>As the frosty days passed by another father
elk appeared, and then another and another.
Each one wanted to be leader of the band.
Many a snowy night the baby elk huddled
close to his mother as he listened to the noise
of the old father elk roaming through the
woods. He could hear them snuffing the
frosty air. They beat the bushes with their
antlers and stamped on the crackling branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
underfoot. The snow lay thick on their bristling
manes. Now here in the valley, now there
high on the ridge, the sound of their whistling
came pealing down through the still white
woods in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Often and often the baby trembled as he
heard the shrill squealing of two old elk fighting
together. Each one was trying to drive
the other away from the band. They rushed
together with a crash, and pushed and strained,
with their antlers locked tight. Though the
prongs could not cut through the tough skin
of their shoulders, still the weaker one always
had to give way and run. The other chased
him off and then came back, whistling and
barking in triumph, to be leader of the band.</p>

<p>In a few weeks the old elk became tired of
fighting. The band settled down to spend a
peaceful winter together. Their fur grew
long and thick to keep out the cold. On they
travelled mile after mile. They were looking
for a sheltered spot to be their home during
the coldest weather.</p>

<p>The old elk walked so fast that the babies
had to gallop to keep from being left behind.
Up hills and down gorges they went crashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
through thickets and over the rocks. They
climbed steep cliffs and went leaping down
narrow trails. Even the little ones were sure-footed.
They never stumbled or slipped as
they bounded over the dead logs and tangled
vines between the trees.</p>

<p>At last they found a wooded spot where the
hills sheltered them from the bitterest winds.
There was grass on the ground. There were
plenty of young trees with twigs and buds
and bark for them to eat. A swift little brook
ran over the rocks not far away.</p>

<p>Here in this place the band of elk spent the
winter. When the snow fell deeper they trod
it into narrow paths by walking from tree to
tree to feed. These paths led to and fro, criss-crossing,
and around in uneven curves all
through the yard, as it may be called. With
every storm the snow beside the paths piled
higher and higher, till the baby could not see
over the edges, even when he stretched up
his neck.</p>

<p>It must have been a dreary winter for the
little fellow. Night after night he huddled
beside his mother to keep warm. Sometimes
the stars sparkled above the white earth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sometimes the wind sifted the icy flakes over
their brown bodies. Day after day of cold
and storm he walked along the paths from tree
to tree. Here he could reach a bunch of dead
leaves, there a cluster of twig-ends, or a mouthful
of bark.</p>

<p>The older elk were so much taller than he
was that they could reach the higher branches
by standing on their hind-legs and stretching
out their necks. Often he went hungry, for
the fodder near the paths was all eaten before
spring. The snow was so deep outside the
yard that he could not touch solid ground with
his feet. Sometimes he pawed through the icy
crust, and dug away the snow from over the
grass.</p>

<p>Once a pack of wolves came prowling near
and tried to drive the elk out into the deep
snow. Though the elk, like all deer, are the
fleetest of mammals, the wolves could run
better over the snow, for their broad paws
did not sink in so far as the elk&#8217;s  slender
hoofs. Instead of running away all the
mother elk rushed squealing after the wolves
and tried to stamp them to death. The mother
elk were always very brave in taking care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
their little ones. The cowardly old fathers
were afraid to fight anything, now that they
had lost their sharp antlers.</p>

<p>Spring came at last, and the snow melted
from the hill-tops and then from the valleys.
The first tender grass began to sprout in the
meadows. The elk left their winter home and
scattered over the plains in search of food.
The sun shone and the soft winds blew.</p>

<p>The baby elk followed his mother, when
she left the others, and started up toward the
mountains. He wandered after her, grazing
as he went, till he lost her in a mountain
thicket. While he was looking for her he
heard a rustling of twigs. He peered through
the branches, and there he saw a new little
baby elk lying on a bed of leaves. The old
mother was standing over him, and licking
his satiny spotted coat with her long red
tongue.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE BEST BUILDER</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Out</span> in the woods rain was pouring
down steadily from the black sky.
It beat against the leaves and trickled
over the trunks of the trees and spattered into
the pond. Now and then a flash of lightning
glimmered over the water and twinkled in
through the hole at the top of the little round
house where the beavers lived.</p>

<p>From the outside this house looked like a
heap of old brush-wood on a tiny island in
the middle of the pond. But inside of it there
was a little room, like a cave, with a smooth
floor and an arched roof. Along the sides of
this room there were five beds of leaves and
grass. On one of these beds lay three baby
beavers fast asleep in the dark.</p>

<p>The other beds were all empty. The big
one at the end belonged to the father beaver.
Before the babies were born in May he had
gone away for the summer. He had started
off with all the other old fathers in the beaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
village to have a good time in the woods up
the brook. They played and feasted on roots
and plants, while the mother beavers stayed
home to take care of the babies.</p>

<p>The other three beds belonged to the mother
and to her two older children. On this rainy
summer night they had gone out to eat their
supper under the trees by the pond.</p>

<p>Suddenly the three baby beavers opened
their eyes with a start, and rolled off their bed.
They had been awakened by the sound of a
loud whack on the water outside. It was a
noise made by the mother&#8217;s  flat tail as she
dived down toward the door of her house.
Her front hall was a tunnel that led from
the bottom of the pond to the floor of the
dark little room. Through this she went
swimming, while the waves bubbled and
splashed around her.</p>

<p>When the babies saw her round head poke
up through the door in the floor they squeaked
and ran to meet her. She was carrying a
bundle of small sticks between her chin and
her fore-paw. Each little beaver sat up on
his hind-legs, with his tail propping him steady
from behind. Then he took one of the sticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
in his hands and began to nibble the bark with
his new yellow teeth.</p>

<p>They were wonderful teeth. After the
babies were too old to live on milk, four
curved teeth grew out in the front of each
little mouth. Two were in the upper jaw and
two in the lower jaw. It was the strangest
thing! The more these teeth gnawed the
sharper they became. The inner side of each
tooth was softer than the outer side. In biting
together, the inner edge wore down faster,
and left the outer edge as sharp as a knife.</p>

<p>The beaver belongs to the <i>Order of
Gnawers</i>. Squirrels and rabbits and rats and
many other mammals belong to this order.
They all have these chisel-shaped front teeth,
which keep on growing all their lives long.
If any one of them is too lazy to gnaw every
day his teeth grow so long that he cannot bite
anything at all. Beavers are the largest of
the gnawing animals, except the water-hog of
South America. They have stronger teeth
than any of the others.</p>

<p>Not long after this stormy night the mother
beaver decided to take the three babies out
with her into the woods. She chose another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
rainy evening because then their enemies were
not likely to be wandering under the dripping
trees. Bears and foxes and wild-cats hate to
get wet, but beavers enjoy feeling the cool
water trickle over their fur and splash on their
tails.</p>

<p>Except for their broad, flat tails, the three
little beavers looked like rats covered with silky
brown fur. The mother seemed like a giant
rat, about three feet long from her round nose
to the root of her tail. Instead of fur her
tail was covered with thick skin. This skin
was so creased and dented that it looked like
scales.</p>

<p>What an exciting evening it was for the
babies! One behind the other they trotted
down the dark tunnel after their mother. At
first the floor was dry and hard. After a few
steps their feet touched something wet. Soft
mud oozed between the fingers on their fore-paws.
Their hind-feet were webbed up to the
toe-nails, and so did not sink in so deep as
their fore-paws. Beavers are the only mammals
which have webs on one pair of feet, and
not on the other pair. They are half land
animals and half water animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>This was not the first time that the three
little beavers had ventured into the tunnel.
More than once before they had crept down
as far as the water and waded about at the
edge. But now they kept right on, splashing
in farther and farther. The water grew deeper
and deeper. In the dark they felt it wash up
to their knees, and then up to their chins, and
finally away over their backs and their heads
to the roof of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Away went the three babies swimming after
the old mother. They held their breaths, and
shut their ears tight. Their small fore-paws
hung down by their sides. They paddled with
their webbed hind-feet, and used their broad
tails as rudders, to send them now this way,
now that.</p>

<p>It seemed the longest time to the last little
beaver before his head popped up into the
fresh air above the pond. He blinked his
light-brown eyes, and winked away the drops
on his eyelashes. Now and then a flash of
lightning glimmered on the trees around the
pond. Of course he did not know yet that
his food came from those tall, shadowy things
at the edge of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Half-way to the shore a round, dark spot
was ploughing through the water, with two ripples
spreading out behind it. It was the head
of the mother beaver. Behind her followed
another head, and then another. The last little
beaver swung his tail around and started after
them. He puffed and sputtered when a wave
washed over his nose. But he did not mind
that at all, because this cool water was much
pleasanter than the stale air in the warm room
at home.</p>

<p>There, under a bush on the bank, he saw his
older brother and sister sitting on their tails,
while they nibbled the bark from some sticks
beside them. When the baby reached his hand
toward the pile they grunted and sniffed at
him. Just then a flash of lightning gleamed
on their long, yellow teeth, and frightened the
little fellow so much that he scampered after
his mother and the two other babies.</p>

<p>They followed a path into the woods. The
father beavers in the village had made it by
cutting down trees and bushes and dragging
them out of the way. It was a straight path,
and more than wide enough for the fattest old
beaver. But the last baby was so much afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of being left behind that he ran without looking
on the ground. He stumbled over two
low stumps, and bumped into a trunk at one
side, before he caught up to the others.</p>

&#8220;Across the pond to feast in the woods.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 65.</p>

<p>He saw the mother beaver standing on her
hind-legs under a tree. She reached up as
high as she could with her mouth and gnawed
off a branch. When it fell crackling and
rustling she called the three babies to come
and learn how to cut their own sticks to eat.
She showed them how to set their teeth against
the bark, and tear off a chip with a jerk of the
head. Another chip and another was gnawed
out till the branch was cut in two. The mother
could bite through a small stick with one snip
of her jaws.</p>

<p>After that, every night all summer long,
the three babies followed their mother out
through the tunnel and across the pond to
feast in the woods. They ate tender grasses
and roots as well as bark. Sometimes they
went out before dark to romp and play tag
in the pond. The biggest little beaver thought
that it was the greatest fun to push the others
off floating logs. He chased them round and
round, splashing water in their faces and mak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ing
them duck their heads. They enjoyed the
fun as much as he did, especially after they
all scrambled upon the bank to rest.</p>

<p>On land, the biggest baby was too fat and
clumsy to move as fast as the other two. They
danced about on their hind-legs, and pretended
to step on his tail or pull his fur. It was
beautiful fur, so fine and thick and soft that
water could not soak through to the skin.
The babies did not have a coat of coarse outer
hair like the old beavers. When tired of play
they sat up and scratched their heads and
shoulders with the claws on their hairy fore-paws.
Then, after combing their sides with
their hind-feet, they curled down in the grass
for a nap.</p>

<p>There were plenty of other little low houses
in the pond, and in each one lived a family of
beavers. The three babies made friends with
all the other babies. Together they explored
every corner of the pond, from the brook at
the upper end to the dam at the lower end.</p>

<p>Very likely the little fellows believed that
the dam had always been there. But in fact
the old beavers had built it themselves. When
they first came to that spot in the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
they found only a brook flowing over a hard,
gravelly bottom. They first cut down a bush
and floated it along till it stuck fast between
a rock and a clump of trees. Next they cut
other bushes, and carried down poles and
branches, till they had a tangle of brush
stretching from one bank to the other. Upon
this they piled sticks and stones and mud, and
then more sticks and stones and mud, and then
still more sticks and stones and mud.</p>

<p>At last the dam was so high and solid that
the water could not flow through. So it spread
out in a pond above the dam till it was deep
enough to trickle over the top and tinkle away
in a little brook under the trees.</p>

<p>Tiny islands were left here and there in the
pond. The old beavers built their houses on
the islands or on the bank. First each mother
and father dug two tunnels from the bottom
of the pond up through the earth to the floor
of their house. One tunnel was to be used
when going in and out during the summer.
The other tunnel led to their winter pantry
under the water. This pantry was to be a
pile of fresh sticks cut in the woods every
autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Around the two holes in the floor the beavers
laid logs and stones in a circle. Upon this
foundation they piled sticks and sod to form
walls and a roof. Then they plastered the
house all over with mud. At the top of the
roof they left a small hole, covered only with
a tangle of sticks. This was for fresh air.
Last of all they swam inside and made the
walls even by gnawing off the sharp ends of
the wood. Then the house was ready to be
furnished with beds of leaves and grasses.</p>

<p>Perhaps during the happy summer the
babies believed that play was the most delightful
thing in the world. But soon the
father beavers came strolling back to the village
to cut down trees for the winter. Then
the little fellows found that work was even
better fun than play.</p>

<p>One night the three babies followed their
parents into the woods and watched them cut
down a tree. The father stood up on his
hind-legs, propping himself with his tail, and
began to cut a notch around the trunk. The
mother helped on the other side. They
gnawed upward and downward, digging out
huge chips with their chisel teeth. The circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
grew deeper and deeper, till the father&#8217;s  head
was almost hidden whenever he thrust it in to
take a fresh bite.</p>

<p>When finally the wood cracked and the tree-top
began to sway all the family scampered
away to the pond. They dived for the tunnel
and hid in the house for a while. There was
danger that some hungry wild-cat had heard
the crash of the branches and had hurried
there to catch them for its supper.</p>

<p>As soon as it seemed safe to do so the
beavers paddled out again and trotted away
to the fallen tree. The parents trimmed off
the branches and cut the trunk into pieces
short enough to carry. The father seized a
thick pole in his teeth and swung it over
his shoulders. As he dragged it toward the
pond he kept his head twisted to one side,
so that the end of the pole trailed on the
ground.</p>

<p>The biggest little beaver tried to drag a
smaller branch in the same way. When he
rose on his hind-legs, so as to walk along
more easily, he forgot to brace himself with
his tail. The branch caught on a stone and
tipped him backwards, heels over head. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
two other babies were rolling a short log by
pushing it with their noses. At the sound of
their brother&#8217;s  surprised squeals they gave the
log a last wild poke. It seemed to make a
jump over a bump, and then tumbled into a
hole. There it stayed, though they pushed
and pulled and puffed and grunted in trying
to get it out again.</p>

<p>It happened that the father beaver reached
the pond just in time to help mend the dam
with his thick pole. A pointed log had
jammed a hole in the dam. The water was
beginning to pour through the hole with a
rush. If the pond should run dry the doors
of the tunnels would be left in plain sight.
Then probably a wolf, or some other enemy,
would hide there to catch the beavers on their
way from the woods to their houses.</p>

<p>The old father pushed his pole into the
water; then he jumped in, and, taking hold
of it with his teeth, he swam out above the
hole. When he let go the water carried the
pole squarely across the break in the dam.
The other beavers cut bushes and floated them
down to weave across the hole. After that
they scooped up mud and stones to plaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the dam till not a drop trickled through the
mended places.</p>

<p>The next work to be done that autumn was
to gather food for the winter. Some of the
trees with the juiciest bark grew too far away
to be easily dragged to the pond. All the
grown-up beavers set to work to dig a canal.
They dug and scooped and gnawed off roots,
and dragged out stones, till they had made a
long canal more than a foot deep. The water
flowed into this from the pond. Then it was
easy enough to float wood from the juicy trees
down to the beaver village.</p>

<p>Even the babies could help in towing the
wood down the canal and across the pond to
the different houses. Some of the wood became
so heavy with soaked-up water that it
sank to the bottom beside the doors, and
could be packed in a solid pile as easily as on
land. Most of the wood, however, kept light
enough to float. Instead of heaping new
sticks on top, the beavers pushed them under
the top branches. Then more was pressed
under that, and more under that, till the pile
reached to the bottom. In the winter, of
course, the top sticks could not be eaten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
because they would be frozen fast in the
ice.</p>

<p>The autumn days were growing frostier
and frostier. After mending the dam and
gathering their woodpiles, the beavers plastered
a last coat of mud all over the outside
of their houses. The mud froze hard and
made the little rooms inside as safe as a
fort, with walls two feet thick. The babies
carried leaves and grasses for their fresh beds.
With a bundle tucked between his chin and
fore-paw, each one hobbled along on three
legs, &#8220;working like a beaver,&#8221; as the saying
is.</p>

<p>One cloudy night, when the beavers were
busy out in the woods, something soft and
cold began to float down through the chilly
air. The biggest baby felt a sting on his
nose. When he put out his tongue to lick it
he touched only a speck of water. Bits of
white sifted on his fur and melted in drops.
Presently the ground began to look lighter
colored. Something fluttered about his head
and settled on his eyelashes. He winked and
sneezed and squeaked to the other babies.
They had never seen a snowstorm before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>When they jumped into the pond to paddle
home something sharp and brittle cracked and
snapped in the icy black water. One of the
little fellows caught a bit in his mouth. It
smarted on his tongue and then it was gone.
It was the first time that he had ever tasted
ice.</p>

<p>The next night, when the beavers swam to
the top of the pond, they bumped their heads
against something hard. It cracked all around
them. They pushed on, with the water lapping
at the jagged edges. After they reached the
shore they found it very tiresome to wade
through the snow. Before the night was
quarter past the old father hurried back to
the pond. He was afraid that the ice might
freeze too thick for them to break their way
home again. He arched his back and slapped
his tail on the water with an echoing whack
to call the babies after him.</p>

<p>All winter long the beavers lived quietly in
their little homes under the snow. Most of
the time they slept, each on his own soft bed
in the dark. Whenever they were hungry
they paddled down the tunnel which led to
the woodpile. Gnawing off some sticks they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
swam back with the bundles under their chins.
They used the middle of the room for a dining-table.
There they nibbled the bark. Then
they carried the peeled sticks back into the
pond. They did not like to have rubbish left
on the floor.</p>

<p>Sometimes the babies grew restless and tired
of staying still in the room. They swam out
into the pond and moved about under the ice.
They hunted for roots of the yellow water-lily.
It must have been hard to hold their
breaths long enough to dig up the roots and
paddle away back into the house. Once the
biggest baby almost had a fight with one of
his playmates over a juicy root. They pulled
at it so roughly that it was torn to pieces.</p>

<p>So the winter months slipped away. At
last spring melted the ice on the pond. Here
and there in the black water little brown heads
came popping up. They went plowing toward
shore, leaving v-shaped ripples stretching out
behind. Up the banks scrambled the beavers,&mdash;mother
beavers and father beavers, big
brother beavers and big sister beavers, and
all the little beavers who had been babies the
year before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Away roamed the fathers up the brook, to
have a good time travelling all summer long.
The grown-up brothers and sisters started out
to build dams and houses of their own. The
little fellows wandered into the woods to find
their dinners of tender buds and twigs. The
mothers ate the bark from fresh sticks, and
then hurried back to carry milk to the new
baby beavers, asleep on their soft beds at
home.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE TIMID ONE</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> nest was a small hole scooped out
of the turf and lined with bits of
fur from the mother bunny&#8217;s  breast.
The five baby bunnies lay packed close together.
Their long ears were pressed flat on
their furry backs, and their hind-legs were
doubled up under their round, little soft bodies.</p>

<p>Over them rested a blanket of dry grass and
fur matted together. The sunlight outside
shone through tiny holes here and there.
Once the bravest bunny poked up the cover
and tried to look out. All he could see was
a little roof of green grasses interlacing above
the nest. The grasses rustled in the summer
breeze.</p>

<p>During the day the babies cuddled down fast
asleep. Sometimes a red ant wandered into
the nest. It clambered down from wisp to
wisp of dead grass and scurried across the
bunnies&#8217; faces. That tickled so that they
screwed up their pink noses and opened their
round bright eyes for a drowsy minute. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a big spider crawled upon the edge and stared
at them with all its eyes, till the bravest bunny
scared it away with a flap of his ears. Another
time a bird flew down to the nest and
pecked at the blanket till its bill stuck through
and almost pricked one of the babies.</p>

<p>Toward evening the bunnies began to wake
up for the night. They squirmed about, curling
their toes, stretching their long legs, and
cocking their ears to listen for the mother
bunny&#8217;s  step. At last they heard the soft
thump-thump-thump of her furry paws as she
came leaping over the grass from the bushes
where she had been dozing. How joyfully
the babies wriggled at sight of her! As soon
as she had lifted the blanket and crept underneath
they snuggled close to her. They were
hungry for the warm milk which she had always
ready for them to drink.</p>

<p>As the days passed the little bunnies began
to grow too big for the nest. Their hind-legs
felt stronger and stronger for jumping. Indeed,
the bravest bunny had a naughty way
of kicking his brothers and sisters. He set his
heels against their soft sides and pushed in
hard jerks, for the fun of making them squirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and squeal. Sometimes they kicked back, but
not very often, because they were afraid to
make much noise.</p>

<p>Their mother taught them to be as still as
they could while she was absent. The only
way for such helpless little creatures to escape
being eaten by their many enemies was to keep
out of sight. Snakes would not notice them if
they stayed quiet in the nest. Hungry hawks
and owls could not find out where they were
hidden if they did not move. The bit of a
blanket looked like a patch of dead grass.
Foxes and wild-cats and the rest could not
smell them so long as they lay still.</p>

<p>They were timid little things, and their ears
seemed to be always twitching to catch the
least sounds. On some warm afternoons they
woke up early, and waited for the mother to
bring their supper of milk. Outside they
heard the plop of grasshoppers jumping from
stem to stalk. The flutter of butterflies and
the buzzing of bees over the clover-blossoms
sounded loud enough. The shrill whirring of
a locust made them tremble and quake. Perhaps
they were afraid that it was something
coming to eat them up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>When the bunnies were strong enough to
leave the nest they went to live in the brush
with their mother. Away they all galloped
over the grass. Their long ears flapped up
and down, and the furry soles of their hind-legs
twinkled behind them. They did not stop
to look around till they were safe in the shelter
of the bushes. Then every one of them
turned, and sat up on his haunches with his
little fore-paws in the air. With their ears
pointed forward, and their round eyes shining,
they looked back at the grassy spot where
they had lived in the hidden cosy nest.</p>

<p>At that very minute, when they were all so
excited and happy, the old mother caught sight
of a fox stealing after them. At a sign from
her the little bunnies sat as still as if they
were made of stone. They were almost the
same color as the sticks and dry leaves around
them. Nobody would notice them unless they
should move.</p>

<p>But that sly old fox was not looking for
them with his eyes; he was following their
tracks, with his nose close to the ground.
He smelled his way nearer and nearer. The
trembling babies could see the sharp white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
teeth between his lips. His narrow eyes
gleamed hungrily. Finally he crept so near
that he could smell them in the air. They saw
him lift his head and snuff in their direction,
one of his fore-paws raised for the next step.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mother bunny sprang out
before his face and darted off helter-skelter
into the woods. She wanted to lead the fox
away from her little ones. Away she dashed
under the bushes and over the logs, up slopes
and down gullies, dodging now this way now
that. Once he was so close that he opened
his jaws to seize her. At that she turned like a
flash, and ran right between his legs. Then
into a swamp she went bounding in great
leaps. There the fox lost sight of her, and
could not find her scent in the water. She
left him nosing hungrily back and forth,
while she hurried back to her babies. They
were sitting as still as stones just where she
had told them to stay.</p>

<p>Almost the first thing the mother bunny did,
after gathering her family in the woods, was
to find different holes for hiding-places. One
hole was in a hollow stump, and another was
in an old woodchuck-burrow. She told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
little ones that they must not go near the
holes, except when they could not escape in
any other way. If they went often they
would make a path, and then their enemies
could find out their hiding-places.</p>

<p>It was pleasant there in the underbrush of
the woods. They felt almost safe with briers
above them to keep away their hungry enemies.
The smell of the mossy earth was warm
and sweet. The buds and leaves and bark were
spicy and fragrant. The bunnies sniffed hither
and thither, twitching their noses and jerking
their ears.</p>

<p>When they stopped living on milk they
learned to feed on grasses and juicy roots
and twigs. The old mother showed them
what was good to eat. Like the beavers and
squirrels the bunnies belonged to the <i>Order
of Gnawers</i>. Each one had four little nibbling
teeth in the front of his mouth, and
grinding teeth in the back. They did not
have such strong teeth as the beavers, who
could cut down trees, or the squirrels, who
gnawed hard nuts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i109.jpg" alt="The Rabbit" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Rabbit.</span><br />

&#8220;It was pleasant there in the underbrush of the woods.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 84.</p>

<p>Though the bunnies could not fight well,
because they had no sharp claws and teeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
they could jump higher and farther and faster
than any of their cousins. They soon found
out that the best way to escape when chased
by their enemies was to trust in the nimbleness
of their legs.</p>

<p>Of course when they saw any hungry animal
looking for something to eat it was best
for them to lie perfectly still so as to avoid
being seen. But if the animal caught sight
of them they must run and dodge and double
and hide for their lives. It was generally
wiser to keep on running till the other lost
the scent rather than to creep into a hole. If
the hungry hunter happened to be a mink or
a weasel he could crawl in after them and kill
them.</p>

<p>The bunnies did not try to dig their own
holes. They were really hares, though they
were so much like rabbits, who were true burrowers.
Once in the woods the bravest bunny
saw a true rabbit. This rabbit had a family
of little ones in a deep burrow. They had
been born blind and naked, but the little hares
had been born with their eyes open and fur
on their bodies. True rabbits were brought
to America from across the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of their dangerous adventures the
bunnies enjoyed the long summer. Every
morning at earliest dawn up they hopped
from the forms. The spot of flattened grass
where each furry body had been resting was
called a &#8220;form.&#8221; Away to the clover-field they
went leaping, one by one. There they drank
the dewdrops, and ate a breakfast of sweet
green leaves. They took a nibble here and a
nibble there. Then they sat up on their
haunches and looked around to spy out a possible
enemy. Their round eyes twinkled this
way and that, and their long ears twitched
nervously at every sound.</p>

<p>The twittering of the birds did not frighten
them. They seemed to know that there was
no danger-signal in the rustling of leaves on
the trees, or the splashing of frogs in the
pond. Even the crackle of twigs under the
footsteps of a deer did not send them running.
They must have known that grass-eating
animals would not harm them.</p>

<p>But the stealthy wriggling of a snake in
the grass sent them scurrying wildly into the
thickest underbrush. When they heard a stick
crack under the trees they seemed to know at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
once what kind of animal was creeping near.
At the soft tread of a fox or a wild-cat they
sat as still as stones, unless they knew that
they had been seen. If that happened they
bounded away in a race for life.</p>

<p>When the sunshine fell bright on some
sandy hillside the bunnies went there, and
stretched out like kittens in the pleasant
warmth. They squirmed and blinked and
turned slowly over and over. They lay on
their backs and waved their paws in the air.
They had five toes on each fore-paw and four
on each hind-paw. Even then, while twisting
and stretching in enjoyment, they were on the
alert. At the sound of a caw from a neighboring
tree, or at the sight of a hawk hovering
far above, they all leapt to their feet, and
scampered out of sight in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Then for hours they sat on their forms in
the shade of the bushes and dozed, half asleep,
but ready to bound away at the first hint of
danger. The scream of a blue jay startled
every bunny wide awake in an instant. The
jays always saw everything in the woods. The
bunnies waited, without stirring, till they could
find out what the trouble was. Sometimes it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
was a dog hunting for rabbits; sometimes it
was a snake coiled in the sun, or a baby fox
playing with his own tail; sometimes it was
only a red squirrel chattering and scolding at
the blue jay.</p>

<p>On warm afternoons the winged ticks hovered
about, biting the bunnies on the tips of
their ears and sensitive noses. Then the bunnies
hid under skunk cabbages in the marshy
spots. The bad smell kept the ticks away. It
was cool and pleasant there. The five babies
lay still, listening to the soft whirring and
drowsy buzzing of insects, in the hot sunshine
beyond the marsh.</p>

<p>After the sun went down the bunnies scattered
to find their supper of tender twigs or
grasses or roots. Always, while they nibbled,
they kept twitching their ears forward and
back. Every minute or two each one paused
to sit erect, and roll his bright eyes in all directions.
All the time his little jaws were working
busily. Then perhaps they dressed their
fur coats, combing their ears with their paws,
and biting the burrs from their vests and socks.</p>

<p>Off with a hop, skip, and jump for a frolic
in an open space in the woods! What a gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
time the five little bunnies had there with their
friends! They went leaping, one after another.
Some tore through the ferns and
hopped over the logs, with their long ears
flapping. They sprang straight up into the
air, kicking out their hind-legs. They jumped
over each other, and scurried wildly round
and round. One whirled about like a kitten,
chasing his own short tail. The bravest
bunny danced on his hind-legs all alone in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>When summer was over the cool days of
autumn found the bunnies friskier than ever.
They had half a dozen smaller brothers and
sisters by this time, because the old mother
had two or three nestfuls of little ones in a
year. There was plenty for everybody to eat
in the woods and fields. The little creatures
feasted on roots and apples and soft-shelled
nuts till they grew round and sleek. The
bravest bunny became so fat and lazy that he
hated to run. Whenever he was being chased
by any enemy he slipped into the first hole
he saw. He would certainly have been caught
one day if the weasel behind him had not
happened to have a lame foot from his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
fight. When he stopped to untangle it from
a strawberry-vine the bunny had time to
escape.</p>

<p>Winter was hard on the bunny family.
They could not run so fast through the soft
snow as on the firm ground. Their enemies
could see their footprints, and follow more
easily. Often and often, when a little fellow
had gone out to nibble twigs and buds, he
heard something move behind him. And
there, not far away, he saw a fox ready to
spring on him.</p>

<p>The bravest bunny slept under a rotten log.
He always slept with his legs doubled under
him, fixed for a great jump away, in case
any hungry animal came nosing around. He
did not mind the cold, for his fur was fine
and thick and warm. Even inside his mouth
the soft fur grew, as well as on the soles of
his feet.</p>

<p>When spring came the bunnies were more
glad than any of the other small creatures in
the woods. It was a joy to feel the warm
breezes blow their fur. They did not care so
much for the warmth as for the tender buds
which it opened on the trees. Green leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
came peeping out of the ground, and flowers
blossomed in sheltered nooks.</p>

<p>Birds were singing, and frogs began their
croaking in the meadows. The woods were
busy with the hurry-skurry of little feet.
Now once more there was plenty for everybody
to eat. The bunnies were glad because
of that. But perhaps they were even more
glad, because now their hungry enemies could
hunt many other animals besides the timid
bunnies.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE ONE WITH THE PRETTIEST
TAIL</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> four baby squirrels were tired of
staying in their soft nest in the hollow
tree. They wanted to find out
what was going on in the world outside. As
they cuddled together in the shadowy hole
they could hear the queerest sounds. They
cocked their heads curiously at the rustling
and whispering of the wind among the leaves.
They heard chirping and singing and a silvery
tinkle, tinkle from the brook. Once a
bee flew buzzing right over their heads, and
made them clutch one another in terror.</p>

<p>One morning, when the old mother squirrel
was away hunting for birds&#8217; eggs to eat, the
smallest baby crept to the mouth of the hole
and peeped out with his round bright eyes.
All around and above him there were wonderful
green things flickering and fluttering.
Twinkles of sunlight danced through the
leaves and dazzled him. Something soft and
cool blew back the new bristles on his lips and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
ruffled his satiny red fur. He was so much
interested that he sat there, staring and staring,
till the other little ones began to squeak
and scold him for shutting out the light.</p>

<p>After he crept down again to the nest the
others climbed up, one by one, and looked out.
They winked and blinked at each wonderful
sight; they sniffed the strange odors, and
twitched their eager little heads at every new
sound. The scream of a blue jay in the tree-top
above sent them scampering inside again,
to cuddle close together in the darkest corner.
It was fun to see something new and exciting,
even if it did make them shiver all over.</p>

<p>Soon the mother squirrel came springing
from branch to branch to reach the hollow.
How the babies squeaked and chattered in
welcome! Very likely they told her about the
wonderful sights and sounds and smells in
the strange world outside the hole. The
smallest one clasped his fore-paws around her
neck, and coaxed her to let them all go out
to find more interesting things. It was stupid
there in the dark nest, with nothing to watch
except the patch of light across the opening
above them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The old squirrel knew that the little ones
were not strong enough yet to leave the nest.
To be sure, they had grown and changed very
much since the first days. Then they had been
ugly little creatures, like tiny pug-dogs, with
big heads, no fur, and their eyes tight shut.
Now they were half as big as she was herself.
Their eyes were like jewels, and their red fur
was smooth as satin.</p>

<p>But their tails, with only fringes of hair
along the sides, were not nearly so fluffy as
the mother&#8217;s. Her tail was long and plumy.
It curved so gracefully over her back that she
seemed to be sitting in its shadow. One name
of the squirrel is &#8220;shadow-tail.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few weeks longer the four babies
scrambled about the doorway and looked longingly
out at the wonderful green tree-world.
They did not dare to step out upon the slender
branches, for fear of falling off. It made
them feel dizzy to look away down to the
ground below. They did not know how to
cling to the limbs with their feet while they
balanced themselves with their tails.</p>

<p>When the young squirrels were almost
strong enough to learn to run and climb in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the tree, the mother began to build an airier
home higher up the trunk. The old nest was
growing too warm for comfort, as summer
brought the long sunny hours. The squirrel
father was not there to help his mate. She
had driven him away before the babies came.
She thought the tree belonged to her, and that
she needed all the room in the hollow for her
little ones. She chased him off to live in the
woods with all the other squirrel fathers till
the babies were big enough to take care of
themselves.</p>

<p>The mother squirrel worked on the new
nest in the early morning. She bit off leafy
twigs and carried them to the top of the tree.
There, where two branches forked, she packed
the sticks and leaves together in a loose ball.
Then she pushed a doorway through, at one
side or another, just as she happened to be
standing. This was not such a neat home
as one in the next tree. That other mother
squirrel built her new nest of strips of bark
tied together with ribbons of soft fibre.
Over the doorway she hung a curtain of
bark, and lifted it up carefully whenever she
went inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the new home was ready. The old
mother hurried down to the hollow and called
the babies to come out and follow her. They
stepped out, one after another, just as carefully
as they could. The smallest baby came
last. He dug his claws into the bark and
hung on. The branch seemed so narrow that
he trembled from fear of falling. The tree
swayed in the wind. The branch bounced up
and down, and a leaf blew in his face. The
poor little fellow shut his eyes, because everything
seemed to be whirling round and round.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again he saw the
three other little ones climbing up the trunk
above him. They clutched the bark with their
claws and moved forward, one paw at a time.
The mother was running on ahead of them.
Every few steps she turned around to coax
them on faster.</p>

<p>Finally they reached a narrow branch which
led over to the new nest. They crawled out
on it, lifting one foot and then setting it
down before lifting another. The farther
they crept the narrower the branch grew
under them. Their little paws began to slip
over the smoother bark. The one in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
tried to turn around, but he was afraid of
losing his balance. So they all three scrambled
backwards to the safe trunk.</p>

<p>The mother ran back to them, and chattered
and scolded. Again and again they started
out over the branch, and then went scrambling
back. When at last the mother had coaxed
them across to the nest she looked around for
the smallest baby. There he was away down
at the door of the old nest. The old squirrel
was tired out. Her fur was ruffled and her
ears drooped. She ran down to the nest and
began to scold the little fellow. He sat up
and put his paws around her neck, as if he
were begging her to let him stay there. But
she started him up the trunk and pushed him
along to the branch. Then she took hold of
him by the neck and carried him across to the
new home.</p>

<p>After that the little ones were taken out
every morning to practise climbing. Little by
little they learned to balance themselves on the
branches. Their tails were fluffy enough by
this time to be of use in balancing. First to
one side, then to the other, each baby tilted his
tail as he crept along, step by step. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
day they could move a little faster. Finally
they were able to chase one another up and
down, from branch to branch. They went
running around the trunks, skipping and leaping
from slender twig to twig, and jumping
from one tree to another, even through the air.</p>

<p>Sometimes one or another missed his footing
after a reckless jump. Often he caught
hold of a branch below by a single toe and
lifted himself up to a firmer foothold. Or
if there was no branch within reach, he
spread out his fur, and flattened his tail, and
went sailing down to the ground, almost as
if he could fly. They never seemed to get
hurt.</p>

<p>The little squirrels appeared to be always
doing something. They turned summersaults
in the grass, or swung by one paw from the
tip of a tough branch. There was always
something to do or to see. Now they chattered
at a blue jay, or chased a toad for the
fun of watching him hop. Now they caught
beetles to look at, or, safe in a tree, they
scolded at some fox slinking along through
the woods. And every day there was the
excitement of finding something to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The babies lived on milk till they were almost
as heavy as their mother. Then she
began to feed them with fruit and buds and
grubs, which she first chewed for them. Like
the beavers and the hares and rabbits each had
four chisel teeth in the front of its mouth.
They needed to gnaw hard nuts or bark every
day to keep these teeth from growing too
long.</p>

<p>When the young squirrels were three months
old in July they were big enough to take care
of themselves. Away they scampered from
the old home tree and found new homes in
stumps and hollows. The smallest one used
to curl up in an old robin&#8217;s  nest to sleep at
night. All day long they were just as busy
as they could be.</p>

<p>There were cones to be gathered from the
evergreens. The little squirrels ran up the
trees in a hurry, and, cutting off the cones
with their sharp teeth, tossed them over their
shoulders to the ground. Every few minutes
they scurried down to bury the cones under
the pine-needles for the winter. Sometimes a
drop of sticky pitch from the cut stems was
rubbed against their fur. That made them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
so uncomfortable that they had to stop and
lick it off.</p>

<p>The squirrels loved to be clean. Ever since
they were tiny babies, with their new red fur,
they always helped one another with washing
their faces, and combing their tails with their
claws. They were careful to run along logs
over a muddy spot. If one happened to get
wet he dried himself with his fluffy tail.</p>

<p>When they were tired of eating seeds and
twigs they hunted for grubs. Clinging to
the bark of a dead tree they listened till they
heard something gnawing beneath the surface
ever so softly. Then, tearing off the bark in
ragged pieces, they pounced upon the flat
whitish grub beneath and ate it up. They
were fond of mushrooms, too, and seemed to
know which were poisonous and which were
good to eat.</p>

<p>But the best time of all came in the
autumn when nuts were ripe. Then what
fun the little squirrels had! Early every
morning out popped the little heads from
the hollow stumps and logs. The big round
eyes twinkled eagerly in every direction.
Then, whisk! they were out, with a bark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
a squeak! Scampering to the top of a tree
each one took a flying leap to a branch of
the next. Up and down, on and across, they
followed the squirrel-paths through the woods
till they reached the grove, where the nuts
were ripening.</p>

<p>It was a busy place, with little wings fluttering
and little feet pattering, and yellow
leaves drifting down in the sunshine. All the
squirrels scurried to and fro, picking one nut
here, and another there. They sat on the
branches, with their bushy tails curving over
their backs, and held the nuts in their fore-paws
to nibble. The smallest baby could open
the hardest walnut, and clean it out in less
than a minute. In the oddest way he seemed
to know exactly where to bore through the shell
so as to strike the broad side of the kernel.</p>

<p>All the while the blue jays and the thrifty
chipmunks were gathering nuts and corn, and
hiding their stores away for the winter. That
seemed so interesting that the squirrels gathered
some too. The smallest one stuffed his
cheeks full of nuts and scampered back to his
latest home in a hollow stump. The next
mouthful he brought was hidden in a fork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
of a tree and covered with leaves. Then he
tucked away a few chestnuts in the cracks of
the bark on an oak-tree. By that time he was
tired of working at this, so he scurried around
to find out how many nuts the other young
squirrels were saving for the winter.</p>

<p>Autumn passed away, and the days grew
colder. In the woods the leaves were all fallen
and the branches were stripped bare of nuts.
Every morning when the squirrels poked out
their heads the air nipped their noses. Frost
sparkled on the dead grass. The chipmunks
had crept into their holes for the winter, and
most of the birds had flown away south.</p>

<p>The squirrels were not quite so gay now as
in the autumn days, when they danced upon
the branches and whistled and chuckled over
the good things to eat and the curious sights
to see. They slept with their warm tails
wrapped over their noses. They still ran
busily through the tree-tops, except when
snow or icy rain kept them shut within their
holes. They ate all the nuts they could find,
and dug up the buried pine-cones. They
climbed the hemlock-trees and ate the seeds.
Sometimes they found a delicious frozen apple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
or some forgotten acorns. Once the smallest
squirrel happened to dig up a heap of chestnuts
from between two stones under the snow.
He could not remember whether he had hidden
them himself or not. How he snickered
and danced when he saw them!</p>

<p>Late in the winter the squirrels had eaten
all the nuts and cones within reach. They
were so hungry on many a day that they
tried to creep into a chipmunk&#8217;s  hole and steal
his store of food. However he was smaller
than they were, and he had wisely made one
bend in his tunnel too small for them to pass.
Then they had to live on buds and barks and
seeds as best they could till spring started the
tender green plants to growing.</p>

<p>The squirrels gnawed the bark of the maple-trees
and drank the sweet sap that came oozing
out. Later there were elm buds to nibble
and birds&#8217; eggs to suck. The woods were once
more green with juicy leaves. All the squirrels
went to housekeeping. Soon in almost
every tree there was a new family of wondering
little squirrels peeping out of their hollow
with their round, bright eyes.</p>

<p class="ph2">ONE THAT SLEEPS ALL WINTER</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Out</span> in the woods the snow fell deeper
and deeper. It piled higher and higher
around the hollow tree in which the
mother bear and her two little bears were sleeping.
The snow had drifted over the opening
and made it all dark inside.</p>

<p>Once in a while the two babies woke up
and whimpered for more milk, as they tumbled
clumsily about on the bed of leaves. Then
the old bear opened her sleepy eyes and licked
their glossy little black bodies while she nursed
them. After that they all fell drowsily quiet
again, and slept and slept.</p>

<p>So the weeks slipped away while the babies
sucked milk, or slept, snuggled close to their
big, warm, furry mother. She had been sleeping
all winter. The autumn before she had
crept into the hollow tree to stay until spring.
She did not eat a mouthful in all that time.</p>

<p>Now as the days grew warmer outside the
old mother bear began to feel more wide
awake. One morning she pawed a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
through the snow at the opening of the hollow
and crawled out to find something to eat.
The two little bears had their eyes open at
last. They lay still on the nest and blinked at
the light that shone dimly in through the hole.</p>

<p>Now and then they heard the soft plop of
a bunch of snow dropping from the evergreen
trees in the woods. The bare branches of the
aspens clicked together in the March wind.
They heard the gurgle of water lapping over
melting ice. The tap-tap-tap of a woodpecker
on the bark of their hollow tree sounded like
thunder inside. Once a red squirrel ran squeaking
over the snow outside.</p>

<p>Before very long they heard footsteps
thumping softly up to the hole, and their
mother&#8217;s  big black body came scrambling in.
The two cubs whined for joy, and rubbed
against her legs. They were hungry again,
and wanted their dinner. The thin old bear
had not found much to eat herself. It was
too early in the year for berries, and the ants
were still in their underground homes. She
had caught a frog in the brook, and found a
few blades of grass to munch.</p>

<p>After that she went out every day, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
seemed as if she grew hungrier and hungrier.
Once she found a frozen deer. After eating
all she could of it she covered the rest with
leaves until the next day. Sometimes she
caught a chipmunk under a log. It was only
in the early spring that the old black bear ate
much meat, for usually she liked fruit and
roots and nuts better.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two little bears stayed safe
in the den till their teeth were cut and the
claws grew sharp and strong. Then they
played outside for a little every day. They
wrestled together and tumbled about in the
sunshine, like clumsy puppies. They were
careful not to creep too far away from the
den. At any strange sound or smell away
they scampered head first into the hole, with
their little wrinkled black feet kicking out
behind them.</p>

<p>At last they were strong enough to set out
on their travels with the old mother. Very
likely she gave them each a good washing
and combing before they started. She could
use her fore-paws like hands. When the cubs
squealed and tried to bite, while she was brushing
them, she slapped them with her big paw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
She could use her paws for digging, and for
carrying food to her mouth. With the sharp
claws she could tear meat or logs to pieces.</p>

<p>The two little ones must have been delighted
to think of leaving the tiresome den in the
hollow tree. Like all bears they loved to
travel. Down the valley they ambled, stepping
clumsily on the flat soles of their feet.
Bears do not walk lightly on their toes, as
do the graceful animals who belong to the
cat family.</p>

<p>The old mother moved on with her head
held low, while the babies waddled after her.
They did not look around much at the wonderful
mountains, with the dark evergreens
and rocks scattered over the yellow gravel.
They did not notice the blue sky above, for
their close-set eyes were rather nearsighted.
Though they could not see very well they
sniffed keenly at every strange smell.</p>

<p>There were many new delicious smells of
warm earth and green plants and furry rabbits
and squirrels and birds and strawberry
blossoms. The cubs imitated their mother in
everything she did. They stepped in the
same foot-tracks, and jumped over the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
logs at the same places. Whenever she stopped
to sniff they rose on their little hind-legs and
twitched their pointed brown noses in the air.</p>

<p>Once they came to a footprint in the gravel.
It was a footprint of a grizzly bear ever so
much bigger than the old black bear. The
cubs looked at their mother to see how she
was acting. Then they copied her. They
drew back their lips from their white teeth
and growled baby growls, while their little
eyes gleamed, and the hairs on their backs
ruffled up stiffly. Grizzlies sometimes killed
black bears.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the spruce grove where
the red ants lived. Scattered over the gravel
there were rounded hills, with tiny red creatures
hurrying in and out of their holes, and
around and to and fro. The little bears
looked at the ants and then watched their
mother as she sat down beside a hill and licked
up a mouthful. After a minute down they
sat, and scraped their pointed tongues over
the ant-hills.</p>

<p>The ants tasted as sour as vinegar, and made
the young ones wrinkle their noses just at first,
because they were used to drinking sweet milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
More than once a fierce little ant gave a nipping
bite to the red tongues that squirmed over
the gravel. That made the babies squeal, and
rub their mouths with their paws. When some
ants crawled up on their fur the bears licked
them off without getting any gravel mixed in.</p>

<p>As the morning sunshine grew warmer the
cubs began to feel tired and sleepy. It had
been such an exciting day ever since starting
out from the old den at sunrise! The mother
walked off to a shady spot under thick evergreens,
and they all curled down for a nap.
The babies snuggled close together, curling
their paws and tucking their noses into their
fur. Closing their eyes, while their fat little
sides heaved in a long sigh of content, they
fell fast asleep. Those ants had tasted so
good!</p>

<p>Very early every morning the two cubs set
off with their mother to find something to
eat. In the heat of the day they took a nap.
Late in the afternoon they went out again
and feasted till dark, or even later, when
berries were plenty. Sometimes they slept in
a hollow log, or in a cave, or in a sheltered
thicket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Before lying down the old bear was always
careful to walk several hundred yards in the
same direction in which the wind was blowing.
If any enemy happened to follow their trail
while they were asleep they could smell him
in the wind and get away in time. One night
they really did smell a wolf coming nearer and
nearer. They stole off through the woods.
The old mother showed the cubs how to step
softly, setting down each big padded foot
where it broke no stick and rustled no leaf.</p>

<p>The bears learned to eat all sorts of food.
There were the delightfully sour ants in their
hills or hidden under rocks and old logs. The
cubs soon grew strong enough to turn over
the rocks and logs for themselves. Leaning
on one fore-leg, each little fellow raised the
stone with the other fore-leg, and gave it a
shove backward, so that it would not fall on
his toes. Away rolled the stone, and down
went the greedy head to lick up every ant in
sight. Then a sweep of a paw uncovered the
beetles and worms and crickets that had run
to hide deeper. Sometimes the old mother
gripped her claws in both sides of a rotten
log and tore it open. The little bears gobbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
up the worms and insects inside as fast as
they could.</p>

<p>All the spring and early summer the three
bears hunted for worms and insects in this
way. They dug up wild roots with their
noses, just as pigs do. One day the cubs
smelled a delicious smell near a flat stone.
They hurried to push the stone away, and
there they found a heap of nuts. They
stuffed their mouths full at once, while the
little chipmunk, to whom the nuts belonged,
squeaked angrily at them from under a heavy
rock.</p>

<p>Later in the summer the berries were ripe.
That was the time for little bears to be happy!
First the fragrant red strawberries grew red
in the fields. The berries were so small, and
the hungry mouths were so large, that many
a bite was mixed with leaves and grass. However,
the cubs did not object to that, even when
a fat white grub or two was pulled up with
the roots of the strawberry plants.</p>

<p>After the strawberries other berries ripened
along the bank of the river at the edge of the
woods. The mother bear knew just where the
biggest ones grew. Many a happy day they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
spent picking the fruit. When the weather
was cloudy and cool they did not stop for
naps. Each one walked along from bush to
bush, raising his head and wrapping his tongue
around a branch. Then with a downward pull
he stripped off leaves and berries and all, and
munched and munched. They could stand on
their hind-feet to reach the higher branches.</p>

<p>The bears had broad grinding teeth in the
sides of their jaws, and so they could chew
their food. Animals like the cat and the dog
have only cutting teeth. They tear their food
into pieces small enough to swallow, and then
gulp it down without chewing.</p>

<p>At noon they went down to the river for a
drink. First they snuffed around carefully,
and then lapped up the water. If the day
was very warm the cubs waded in and lay
down to cool off. Sometimes the old mother
took her nap lying in the water. Once in
a while they caught a frog or a live fish by
giving a jump and quick slap before it could
swim away.</p>

<p>In late summer the wild plums ripened in
the woods. The old bear shook the trees and
sent the red fruit hailing down upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
scrambling cubs. On one specially delightful
day they found a hollow tree in which bees
had been storing honey for the winter.</p>

<p>They saw the bees buzzing around a hole
high up on the trunk. One of the cubs
climbed up. Wrapping his hind-legs around
the tree he held on with one fore-paw, while
with the other he dipped out the honey and
stuffed it into his mouth. All about him the
air was gray with bees. They stung him on
his nose and ears and eyelids. He did not
mind that much, except when one bit his
tongue. Then he thrust out his tongue and
mumbled and growled for a moment. He
had never before eaten anything so delicious
as honey.</p>

<p>After the pleasant summer came the frosty
autumn with its ripening nuts. The cubs
climbed trees and sat on the branches, with
their black legs dangling. The old bear shook
the trees to bring down the nuts. Once she
shook so hard that one of the little bears
lost his hold and fell. He tumbled down in
such a limp soft heap that he was not hurt
at all, but bounded up again like a rubber
ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>At another time the mother saw a big grizzly
bear coming through the woods. When the
cubs heard her warning grunt they shot up
the tree like jumping-jacks, and hid in the
thick leaves near the top. There they were
safe, for the grizzly was too heavy, and its
claws were too long, for climbing. Grizzly
bears are the largest beasts of prey in the
world. Sometimes when very hungry they
will eat their cousins, the black bears.</p>

<p>The days kept growing colder little by little,
and twilight came a few minutes sooner every
evening. The air was frosty at night, and
somehow the three bears felt drowsier and
drowsier. Their naps lasted longer every
afternoon. On some cold days they curled
up on dry ledges in the sunshine and slept
from morning to night. They were sleek and
fat from their feasts of acorns and nuts.</p>

<p>All this while the old mother bear was becoming
more and more cross. When the cubs
tried to play with her she slapped them, and
pushed them away whimpering. It was time
for them to take care of themselves. Very
likely she did not want to be bothered with
them all winter long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>So one day the two little bears walked off
by themselves. They roamed through the
woods, looking for some place which would
be a warm den. One of them dug a cosy
hole under a big root and curled down for
his winter&#8217;s  sleep. The other crept between
two rocks that almost touched over his head.</p>

<p>Outside the snow began to fall. It blew in
through the cracks and powdered down upon
the little bear&#8217;s  thick fur. Very soon it had
stuffed all the cracks and drifted higher over
the rocks and logs. It went whirling from
the ledges into the valleys; it fell deeper and
deeper over the three dens and shut out the
cold.</p>

<p>The little bears breathed more and more
slowly, with their noses warm in their furry
fore-arms. Their little fat sides rose and fell
ever so faintly. Their hearts beat more softly.
They were fast asleep for the winter, while
the snow fell and the icy winds blew on the
mountains without.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE WISEST ONE</p>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">Almost</span> the first thing that the smallest
baby fox remembered was being
carried in his mother&#8217;s  mouth from
one den to another. His woolly little red body
hung limp between her long white teeth. That
was the safest way; for if he had held stiff
or wriggled she might have closed her jaws
tighter and pinched him.</p>

<p>It was very early in the morning, and the
rising sun was just lighting up the tops of
the trees. The birds were singing their gayest
May songs. Here and there dewdrops
sparkled, where the level sunbeams glinted
across the leaves. Under a bush a rabbit sat
up very still, and stared with round, frightened
eyes at the mother fox.</p>

<p>The mother fox did not see the rabbit.
She stepped along swiftly. Her slender paws
hardly rustled a leaf or snapped a twig. She
looked like a graceful red dog, with pointed
ears and yellow eyes and beautiful plumy tail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
This plumy tail seemed to float out in the air
behind her, as if she were blowing lightly before
the wind.</p>

<p>When she reached the new den she did not
stop an instant at the front door. The freshly
dug earth was scattered around there in plain
sight. In digging this new burrow she and
the father fox had left the dirt there on
purpose, to make their enemies think that this
hole was the real entrance to the den. A few
feet underground they had closed the tunnel
with a heap of earth. At the other end they
had made a new opening hidden behind gray
rocks in a thicket.</p>

<p>To this secret door the mother fox carried
the baby, and set him down on his four thick
legs. He looked like a little red lamb with
yellow eyes. Into the hole he scrambled, and
crept through the tunnel to the dark den at
the end. On the nest of leaves inside he found
his four brothers and sisters snuggling together.
The old mother had carried them there
one by one.</p>

<p>The day before, when a big dog came nosing
about the old den, the father fox led him
away through the woods. He could run the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
faster, and so he kept on, with the dog chasing
him, till the dog was tired out. Then he
and the mother hurried to dig this new den
and move the babies before the dog came back
to the old place again.</p>

<p>In going from one den to the other the old
foxes were careful not to walk in a straight
path. If they did that of course the dog
could follow them by smelling their trail.
They took a roundabout path every time.
They trotted around a swampy meadow and
crossed a brook by stepping from stone to
stone. The wet ground hid the scent of
their paws.</p>

<p>This journey to the new den was the first
time that the young foxes had been outdoors.
As they were carried by the neck they could
not twist their heads around to see very much.
But still, they must have enjoyed the light and
the fresh air. They did not want to keep on
staying all the time in the dark den. So early
one morning they came scrambling out after
their mother.</p>

<p>The smallest baby fox crawled out last of
all. For a moment he stood very quiet on
all four paws. Then he sat down and cocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his little head on one side while he looked
around. The old father was lying down in
the sunlight just outside the thicket. Two of
the babies trotted over to him and began to
play with his tail. Two others climbed upon
the mother&#8217;s  back and pushed each other off.
There they wrestled, rolling over and over in
each other&#8217;s  paws.</p>

<p>The smallest baby wanted to make the others
pay him some attention. He lifted his sharp
little black nose and opened his mouth and
began to bark&mdash;bow-wow-wow, bow-wow-wow&mdash;till
the others stopped playing. They
came running over to ask what was the matter.
He told them something in the fox language
by rubbing his cool wet nose against
theirs. Then they all five trotted about and
explored the thicket by smelling of everything
within reach.</p>

<p>They poked their noses into the grass and
against the trees and bushes and over every
stick and stone and leaf on the ground. To
their keen nostrils everything had a different
smell. When the smallest baby smelled a stick
he could tell which little brother or sister had
been smelling it just before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>As the sun rose higher and the air grew
warmer the little fellows sat down and rested,
with their tongues lolling out of their mouths.
Like all foxes and wolves and dogs they perspired
through the tongue and the soles of
their feet. After a while the mother gave a
low growl to say that it was time to go back
into the den. In they scampered head first,
and curled up for a nap, with their fluffy tails
over their noses.</p>

<p>When the babies cut their teeth the mother
stopped feeding them with milk. After that
she and the father fox were kept busy hunting
for food for the hungry young ones. Sometimes
they hunted in the daytime as well as
at night. Oftener, however, the old mother
stayed near the den to keep guard when the
little foxes came out to play every afternoon.</p>

<p>Such fun as the five little ones had together!
They ran round and round, chasing their tails.
One hid behind a tuft of grass and jumped
out to scare the others. Another climbed upon
a rock and then was afraid to slide down. One
went rolling down a small hill while another
capered beside him and pretended to snap at
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Once the smallest baby saw a grasshopper
whizz past. He saw where it was hiding under
a leaf. He crouched down as low as he could
and crept toward it. Without making a noise
he crawled from bush to stone, from stone to
tuft of weeds, till he was near enough to
spring and catch it in his paws. All the others
ran to see what he had caught. The mother
came, too, from the place where she had been
watching him. She was proud of him because
he was learning to hunt while so young.</p>

<p>As evening came on and the shadows lengthened
under the trees the mother fox sent the
babies into the den and walked away to hunt
for a supper. The smallest fox happened to
be the last one in. He turned when just inside
and poked his pointed nose out to watch
her as she trotted away into the woods.</p>

<p>A few hours later, when they heard her low
call at the mouth of the burrow, out they came
tumbling. Sometimes she had a rabbit hanging
in her mouth, with its long legs on one
side and its long ears on the other. Sometimes
she had a young turkey thrown over her shoulders,
or a fringe of field-mice hanging by the
tails from her lips. Once she brought a wood-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>chuck,
and at another time a string of little
chickens held by the necks.</p>

<p>The babies always ran and snatched for a
piece. Then each trotted off alone to eat it.
When they were not hungry they played with
the food. They nibbled the bits, first tossing
them into the air and then springing to catch
them. They could not use their fore-paws so
freely as animals like the cat. They growled
and shook the mice to and fro in their mouths.
Sometimes they snatched from one another
and snapped and snarled crossly. Once the
smallest fox had a fight. Every time he flew
at his brother the other whisked his bushy tail
in front of his face, and all the little one got
was a mouthful of fur.</p>

<p>By and by the young foxes were taken out
to learn to hunt for themselves. There was
ever so much to learn because every different
animal must be hunted in a different way.
The main lesson was to keep their eyes open
and their ears alert and their noses keen for
smelling. They must be quick to jump and
wise at all sorts of tricks.</p>

<p>They learned to catch chickens by hiding
near the place where the flock was feeding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
When a chicken strayed near enough quick
as a flash out jumped the fox and caught it
by the neck. They chased rabbits and pounced
on busy squirrels. They hunted meadow-mice
in the grass, and stole silently upon careless
woodchucks.</p>

<p>The smallest baby caught a chipmunk in
almost the same way as he had caught the
grasshopper. He saw the little brown animal
feeding near its hole. Very slowly and carefully
the fox began to walk up to it. Every
few moments the chipmunk sat up and looked
around. When he did this the fox stood still,
and so the chipmunk did not notice him. As
soon as the chipmunk dropped down on all
four feet and began to nibble again, the young
hunter crept several steps closer. He held his
tail pointing out straight behind. At last, with
a rush and a jump, the fox had the chipmunk
between his teeth.</p>

<p>All summer long there was plenty to eat in
the woods. The five young foxes grew as
strong and tall as their parents. They left
the old home and scattered to dig new dens
here and there in the woods and fields. They
all knew how to take care of themselves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>Even as babies they had learned to hold still
as a stone at any strange sound. If they
heard it again they ran to the den as fast
as they could scamper. More than once while
they lay blinking comfortably in the sunlight
they saw the old father fox spring up with
his ears pricked forward and his eyes gleaming.
With his tail erect, his fore-feet planted
in front, and his hind-feet on the spring, he
listened to the sound that had startled him.
Perhaps it was the bark of a dog or the
scream of a blue jay over a newcomer in the
woods. It was always safer for grown foxes
to run from an enemy than to try to fight,
for they were swift-footed creatures.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i157.jpg" alt="The Fox" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Fox.</span><br />
&#8220;Now and then the fox stopped to listen.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 131.</p>

<p>Once the smallest fox was really chased by
a dog. The dog smelled his trail near a flock
of chickens. He ran on with his nose to the
ground till he saw the fox sitting under a tree
with his tongue hanging out of his mouth.
At the sound of the bark the fox looked back.
Then off and away he ran lightly over the
hills and through the fields. His fluffy tail
floated in the wind.</p>

<p>Now and then the fox stopped to listen to
the baying of the dog far behind him. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
or three times he whirled around, chasing his
tail and capering. He knew that he could run
the faster. He picked his way from stone to
stone across a brook because he did not like
to wet his feet. Then he ran up a tree that
had fallen in a slant. He jumped from the
end far over to a dead log and scampered
across a rocky field. From the top of a hill
he looked back and watched the dog trying
to find the scent over the brook and around
the slanting tree. When he was tired he hid
in a hole.</p>

<p>When autumn came the young foxes gathered
on many a frosty night for a romp before
going to their hunting. They galloped to and
fro, jumping over one another and springing
from log to log. It was almost the same as
if they were puppies again, frisking before
the old burrow. They wrestled and rolled and
whirled around after their tails. Then away
to their silent hunting!</p>

<p>When the snow fell and the cold winds blew
life was harder for the foxes. Through the
day generally they slept in their dens, with
their tails curled over their noses and fore-paws.
Out they crept at sundown to hunt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
a rabbit or unwary squirrel, to trap a partridge,
or snatch a squeaking mouse at the
edge of a stone.</p>

<p>Many a night some young fox went home
hungry. Often he lay in the snow hour after
hour till his legs were stiff, while he waited
for a rabbit that stayed safe in its hole. More
than once he made a dive into the snow after
a partridge, only to see the bird flutter up
before his very nose and fly into a tree. Very
likely, as he sat looking hungrily up to the
branches, he wished that he could climb trees.
Undoubtedly the partridges and the squirrels
did not wish any such thing.</p>

<p>Before spring came at last the foxes were
hungry enough to eat anything. Indeed one
day in early March, while the smallest one was
roaming through the woods, he happened to
spy a garter-snake coiled on a rock in the
sunshine. He jumped for it and gulped it
down in a hurry. The next day he caught a
turtle and a frog. The frog was so stiff and
sluggish from its winter&#8217;s  sleep that it could
not hop at all.</p>

<p>By that time it seemed that spring was
really at hand. As the foxes never ate grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
or leaves they did not care about the fresh
green plants and buds through the woods.
Nevertheless they knew very well that rabbits
liked roots, and squirrels nibbled twigs, and
field-mice were hungry for the sprouting
seeds. When these small animals came out
to eat, the foxes could hunt them more easily
than in winter.</p>

<p>Once more the soft winds blew among the
branches and the leaves flickered in the sunlight.
The birds were singing overhead in
the tree-tops. And here and there in the hidden
thickets new broods of little red foxes
were frisking together at the mouths of the
burrows.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i165.jpg" alt="The Wolf" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Wolf.</span><br />

&#8220;It was the father wolf coming in.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 137.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> old mother wolf came home from
her hunting, licking her black lips.
Her four woolly babies scrambled out
of the den among the rocks, and ran to meet
her. They wagged their little tails, and barked
joyous baby barks. They rubbed against her
legs, and reached up their little faces to kiss
her on her cool nose.</p>

<p>After smelling them all over the old wolf
lay down beside them in the den to give them
their dinner. The strongest little wolf was
getting tired of milk. When he had nursed
for a few minutes he began to play, climbing
up his mother&#8217;s  shaggy back and rolling down
again, with his legs waving in the air.</p>

<p>Soon he pricked up his ears at the sound of
a footstep outside the den. Then he sniffed
the air. Sure enough! It was the father wolf
coming in with something furry in his mouth.
The cubs ran to smell it. Somehow the smell
made the strongest little fellow feel so hungry
that he tried to bite it with his new sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
teeth. He snapped and snarled when the old
wolves dragged it away from him.</p>

<p>Very likely this reminded the parents that
they must now teach the young ones to eat
meat. So on the next evening they left the
babies safe asleep in the den and trotted away
together. They looked like two fierce dogs,
with shaggy gray and black hair, pointed ears,
and bushy tails. Their yellow eyes were set
more slanting than the eyes of dogs.</p>

<p>They caught a rabbit by taking turns in
chasing it till it was tired out. Then they
trotted home. At the mouth of the den the
mother gave a low call. There was a rustle of
woolly bodies over the leaves and grasses of
the nest back in the dark. And out tumbled
the cubs, wriggling with joy. The father
wolf, with his big teeth glittering behind his
whiskered lips, tore the rabbit into pieces, and
showed the young ones how to eat. Each
snapped at his piece, and ran to one side alone
to gnaw and pull it into bits small enough to
swallow. They did not chew their food, because
like other flesh-eating animals, except
bears, they did not have any grinding teeth.</p>

<p>After the strongest baby had finished his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
piece he tried with a rush and a snap and a
snarl to snatch from another little fellow. But
the other cub held on tight with his little jaws.
Then, growling and rolling his yellow eyes to
watch his greedy brother, he dug a hole with
his nose in one corner and buried the rest of
his piece. He did this without being taught
at all. Every wolf that ever lived knew
enough to bury his food when he did not want
to eat any more.</p>

<p>After their dinner the mother led the babies
down the valley to lap water from the brook.
It was dark by this time. Stars were twinkling
in the sky. The shadowy trees swayed
to and fro in the night wind. One little cub
sat down on his haunches, pointed his nose at
the sky, and howled. The little ones trotted
here and there, smelling every stick and stone.
The scream of a far-away panther on the
mountain made the old wolf growl and bristle
the hairs on her back. She hurried back to
the den and sent the cubs in to sleep, while she
stole off to hunt for her own supper.</p>

<p>In the morning the little wolves crept out to
play about in the sunshine. They rolled and
tumbled and wrestled in much the same way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
as the young foxes. Like the foxes the wolves
belonged to the dog family of flesh-eaters.
The little wolves were stronger and larger and
fiercer than the little foxes. They did not
have such bushy tails.</p>

<p>One young wolf found bits of the rabbit&#8217;s
fur. He tossed and worried them, and gnawed
so hard that the fur flew in his throat and
nose and made him sneeze. Another saw a
butterfly, and went plunging after it on his
unsteady little legs. He jumped up at it, and
opened his mouth to snap at it. He did not try
to slap at it, as a little panther might have done,
for he could not use his fore-paws like hands
so easily as animals of the cat family.</p>

<p>All summer long there was plenty to eat.
The deer in the mountains were fattening on
the green grass. They could not fight very
well then, because their new antlers were too
soft. There were flocks of sheep on the plain.
The old parent wolves prowled about every
night, and often hunted in the daytime. It
kept them busy enough to supply the four
hungry cubs.</p>

<p>The two hunted together. Sometimes one
hid beside a deer trail, while the other chased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the deer nearer and nearer. When the deer
passed the spot where the first wolf was hiding
he sprang out and caught it from behind.
Sometimes they took turns in chasing a deer till
it was tired out. The deer could run the faster,
but it always lost time by looking around to
see how near the wolf was getting. Once in
a while one escaped by running into the middle
of a patch of cacti. The wolves could not
follow there without getting their feet full
of thorns. But the deer&#8217;s  tough hoofs protected
its feet.</p>

<p>Later in the summer the young wolves were
taken out to learn to hunt with their parents.
Their legs were so long that they were good
runners, though they could not climb or spring
very well. The nails on their toes were short
and blunt from walking, for they could not
be drawn back and so kept sharp, like the claws
of animals belonging to the cat family.</p>

<p>The cubs wore thick coats with soft under-fur
beneath the coarse shaggy hair. Their
yellow eyes were keen, and their sensitive noses
were quick to catch every smell of the wilderness.
Their jaws were strong for snapping,
and their many teeth were sharp for biting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and tearing. They could scent the wind and
howl when a storm was coming.</p>

<p>About sunset, one summer day, the little
wolves followed the old ones away from the
den. Down the canyon they trotted silently,
winding in and out among the rocks like gray
shadows. Far up the mountain-side a flock
of wild sheep went leaping away in terror at
sight of the wolves.</p>

<p>On the plain below rabbits scurried off,
bounding from hillock to hillock. Prairie-dogs
dived, squeaking, into their holes. A fox
looked around in fright, and dodged into a
clump of underbrush. A small herd of buffaloes,
on their way to the river, ran close
together and stood with their horns outward,
while the wolves skulked past.</p>

<p>Perhaps, just at first, it seemed strange to
the cubs to see all other animals afraid of their
parents. At home the two shaggy old wolves
were gentle and warm and soft toward the
little ones. They fed them and watched over
them and taught them all they knew. The
babies whimpered when the old wolves left
them alone in the den; and they barked and
frisked with joy to see them come home again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Out here on the plain it was different. The
sight or smell of a wolf sent all the timid wild
creatures flying in a scramble and hurry-skurry
to get safely out of the way. The
sound of the hungry howling made them
tremble with fear, for they knew what it meant.
It meant something shaggy and gray, with
gleaming eyes, galloping swiftly nearer and
nearer. It meant the glitter of long teeth behind
grim black lips. It meant a spring and a
snarl and tearing pain, and then a crunching
of bones.</p>

<p>The first lesson that the young wolves
learned was to take the trail and run it to
earth. The father wolf showed them how to
do it. He led them over the plain toward a
cluster of trees along the river. He lifted his
nose and snuffed the air. He smelled something
in the wind that was blowing toward
him from the woods. It was not the smell of
trees or grass or flowers or birds or squirrels.
It was the smell of deer.</p>

<p>The four cubs followed the old one as he
galloped under the trees. They saw him stop
and go sniffing here and there with his nose
to the ground. Yes, he could smell the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
where the slender hoofs had been pressing the
grass a few minutes before. He ran on, with
his nose to the ground. The others galloped
after him, their heads low, their tongues hanging
out, their tails held straight behind.</p>

<p>Once the father wolf howled. The young
ones looked up for an instant. There, far
away in the dusky woods, the deer were
bounding lightly over the dead logs. They
turned their pretty heads now and then to
look back, till they vanished from sight. The
wolves kept on for a few miles, learning to
pick up the scent on the run. Then they
found a half-eaten buffalo in a hollow, and
stopped there for supper.</p>

<p>Through the late summer and early fall the
young wolves hunted with their parents. During
the day they stayed up in the mountains
and slept in sheltered places. Sometimes they
were scattered miles apart. At nightfall they
called to one another with piercing howls, till
they finally gathered about the old father wolf.
Then they all set out to hunt together.</p>

<p>Sometimes they moved single file, stepping
in one another&#8217;s  tracks. They swam across the
river and stole noiselessly through the woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
The timid sheep were easiest to kill because
they could not fight. When they found a calf
or sick old buffalo one sprang at his head while
the others attacked from behind and bit his
hind-legs. If the wolves went too near a herd
the old buffaloes tried to hook them. Once a
cub started to catch a young elk, but he was
chased away by the old mother elk. They
butted at him with their heads and struck at
him with their sharp hoofs, while he ran with
his tail tucked under him.</p>

<p>Autumn was pleasant enough with its bright
days and frosty nights. The busy little creatures
of the woods were gathering in their
winter stores. Buffaloes and deer were fat
from their summer&#8217;s  feeding, and could not
always run fast to get out of the way when
chased by the wolves. Plump rabbits and
prairie-hens were everywhere for the catching.
Many a night the cruel wolves killed
more than they could eat.</p>

<p>But soon winter came with its shortening
days and gray storms lowering above the
horizon. Snow fell, and icy winds blew across
the frozen land. The deer and elk and antelope
gathered in sheltered valleys. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
wolves wandered down from the mountains,
and roamed far and wide, hunting for food.</p>

<p>So long as the fresh snow lay soft and
powdery in the gullies they could not run fast
enough to catch anything, but when the snow
packed hard, and an icy crust formed over the
drifts, their spreading feet did not sink in
deeply. Then they could go out and hunt
the elk and the deer, whose small hoofs cut
through the crust at every bound.</p>

<p>The young wolves felt hungry all the time.
Sometimes, when a blinding storm shut them
into their den among the rocks, they went without
eating day after day. The fine snow sifted
down upon their glossy winter coats as they
lay close together, snuggling their cold noses
into one another&#8217;s  fur. Many a night they
dreamed of eating, and snapped and swallowed
greedily in their short, uneasy sleep. Once,
in nosing about hungrily, the strongest little
wolf happened to find a bone that he had
hidden and forgotten weeks before. With a
spring and a snarl he crunched it between his
white teeth and gulped it down in a hurry.</p>

<p>One winter evening the four cubs, with their
parents and five or six others, were following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
a herd of buffaloes. On galloped the buffaloes
over the frozen plain. Behind and around them
the dark forms of the wolves seemed to rise
from the bushes and follow noiselessly. There
was not a sound of a snap or a snarl. Now on
this side, now on that, now lost in the shadows,
the wolves galloped tirelessly on and on.</p>

<p>Here and there two eyes gleamed in the
dim circle of a head, or bared white teeth glittered
for an instant. Then again lost in the
dusk, without the patter of a footfall on the
snow, they edged nearer and nearer. Finally
there was a sound of snarling and yelping.
The wolves were fighting together over a dead
buffalo. They ate him, and then broke away
over the plain at a full jump, howling as they
went.</p>

<p>Winter was over at last. The wolves were
thin and fiercer than ever. Their grim black
lips were always ready to curl back over their
teeth at the smell of food. They felt such a
dreadful gnawing emptiness inside that they
were frantic to eat anything. When they
began to grow weaker and weaker from
hunger the welcome spring brought them new
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Now in the time of pleasant weather and
the plentiful food it was no longer necessary
for the pack of wolves to hunt together.
They were strong enough to look out for
themselves. So the wolves scattered to make
their summer homes in the loneliest spots
among the mountains.</p>

<p>The weeks passed by, and soon there was
many a new family of woolly little cubs frisking
about the rocky dens. The fathers and
mothers watched them lovingly. The black
lips seemed almost smiling and the fierce eyes
grew soft. They were gentle and happy there
together, though so cruel and hateful to all
the world outside.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE ONE THAT DIGS THE BEST</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Deep</span> down in their dark room underground
the five mole babies lay fast
asleep on a soft bed of leaves and
grasses. The bed was not much bigger than
a robin&#8217;s  nest. The little moles cuddled together,
with their pointed pink snouts resting
on one another&#8217;s  satiny bodies. Their little
hind-feet sprawled behind them, and their big
flat hands, with the pink palms turned outward,
were spread close to their necks.</p>

<p>Presently the fattest little mole opened his
black specks of eyes, though they were not
of much use down there in the dark. He
wriggled his pointed snout as he sniffed the
air. The faintest of breezes floated toward
him through one of the round openings in
the wall. It was a breeze caused by something
running toward the nursery. Tiny feet
came galloping nearer and nearer. There was
a light rustle of fur brushing along the tunnel.
It was the mother mole hurrying back from
her hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i183.jpg" alt="The Mole" /></div>

&#8220;The greedy young ones shoved and pushed and fought
as if they were starving.&#8221; <i>Page</i> 152.</p>

<p>All the little moles jumped wide awake in
an instant when their sensitive bodies felt the
quiver around them. It seemed to them that
the earth shook under the mother&#8217;s  pattering
feet. Of course they were not afraid, because
they knew from the smell who was coming.
And then, just as soon as they smelled the
worm that she was carrying in her mouth,
they began to tumble over one another to
snatch at it.</p>

<p>The greedy young ones shoved and pushed
and fought as if they were starving. They
pulled at the worm with their claws, and
snipped off bits with their sharp teeth. Even
after it was all eaten they went nosing
around in the dark and squeaked for more.
The fattest little fellow crawled so far into
one of the tunnels that he almost slipped
into the tiny well which the parent moles
had dug when they made this underground
home.</p>

<p>The poor old mother lay down to rest for
a few minutes. It seemed as if she did not
have time to eat or sleep since the babies had
cut their teeth and learned to eat worms.
They were always hungry. As for herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
though the old father helped her hunt she
was really growing thinner every day. The
young moles were six weeks old now, and
it was time that they learned to hunt for
themselves.</p>



<p>The babies were eager enough to learn to
dig and hunt. They were tired of staying in
that dark nursery, even if it was so comfortable,
with its domed roof and soft, dry bed.
Perhaps they wished to poke their heads above
ground just once and find out what the world
was like. They did not know the difference
between day and night yet, for where they
lived it was always dark.</p>

<p>When at last the five young ones started
out to learn to dig they followed the mother
in single file along the main tunnel. This
main tunnel was long and straight. Its walls
were pressed smooth by the bodies of the old
moles in their many journeys to and fro.
Branching off in every direction from the
main road there were side tracks zigzagging
and curving hither and thither. These side
tracks had been dug by the parents when
they were chasing worms or hunting for
grubs and beetles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The babies scampered on to the end of the
main tunnel. There the ground happened to
be soft enough for their little claws. They
crowded against one another, and squeaked
and twitched their short tails impatiently.
Their pink snouts were already bending and
twisting in eagerness to be a-digging.</p>

<p>The fattest little fellow was in such a hurry
to begin that he did not wait to be told. He
nosed along the wall till he found a good
place to start. Then planting his small hind-feet
down flat, to brace himself, he set his
tough snout against the dirt and pushed as
hard as he could. At the same time he dug
his claws into the wall and shovelled away with
both his big broad hands.</p>

<p>There they went&mdash;the five babies&mdash;digging
five little tunnels in five different directions.
The dirt flew thick and fast as they
shovelled it out and tossed it aside. But the
specks of eyes were safely hidden under the
fur, and the invisible ears and nostrils were
kept closely covered too. When the dirt
clung to their satiny gray fur they shook it
off clean with a quick shrug of the skin.
The hairs of the fur grew straight out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
so it made no difference whether it was
rubbed one way or another. It was never
bristly or rough.</p>

<p>It must have been fun to go scrambling
through earth almost as birds fly through air
or fishes swim through water. The moles had
such tough snouts and strong arms and
powerful hands that they could burrow better
than any of the other mammals.</p>

<p>One little mole burrowed on till his arms
were so tired that he gave it up. He crept
backward down his new tunnel to the spot
where the old mother was waiting. Another
kept on digging faster and faster till he ran
his pink snout bump against a stone, and
almost made it bleed. A third pushed on
and on till he reached a patch of slimy mud
that caved in over his back and sent his feet
slipping and sprawling. The fourth dug till
he came plump upon a fat white grub curled
among some roots of grass. The little mole
gave a jump and gobbled it down quick as a
wink.</p>

<p>The fattest baby burrowed farther and farther
till he felt the soil crumbling above him.
Something warm was shining on his gray fur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
He lifted his head and poked his long snout
up into the sunlight. He blinked his twinkling,
tiny eyes and sniffed the strange fresh
air. But he stayed there only for a minute,
because he did not like it the least bit. The
light dazzled him, and the warmth dried his
cool, pink hands and made his head ache
and his snout twitch uneasily. So after that
one disagreeable minute he turned and kicked
up his little hind-feet as he dived back into
the moist, cool, dark, delightful places underground.</p>

<p>After this first lesson in digging the five
young moles were running in and out of the
nursery every few hours, night and day. It
was easy enough to burrow away in search
of the stupid white grubs or the beetles lying
sleepy and still in the soil; but it was harder
and much more exciting to hunt earthworms,
because they always tried to wriggle off as
fast as they could go.</p>

<p>Then how the dirt flew as the little hunter
burrowed madly in pursuit! Now in this
direction, now in that, he chased, pushing with
his snout and tearing with his claws. Once
in a while he stopped quiet to listen and feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the ground for the faint quivering caused
by the worm in its squirming hither and
thither.</p>

<p>An hour or so of such lively work was
enough to tire even a stout young mole.
After eating what he had caught, sometimes
he ran back to take a nap on the soft bed in
the nursery. Sometimes he lay down in the
main tunnel to rest; but that was not so
pleasant, for it seemed as if one or another
of his brothers and sisters was forever trying
to scramble over him.</p>

<p>The busiest time for hunting was at night,
or in the early morning, because then the
worms began to move about after lying quiet
all day. In dry weather the worms went
deeper into the ground to find moisture. In
wet weather they wriggled toward the surface,
swallowing bits of dirt as they went.
The little moles liked rain best because it was
much easier to push through the light soil
above than to tunnel through the hard ground
below.</p>

<p>After the young ones learned to hunt for
their own food it was not long before they
had found and eaten every worm and grub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and beetle anywhere near. The old and new
tunnels ran in every direction, curving, zigzagging,
and criss-crossing through the ground.
There was hardly a spot of solid earth under
all the grass in that meadow.</p>

<p>Now and then on cool nights the whole
hungry family crept outside and prowled
about, looking for lizards, snails, or frogs.
Once in a while one of them found a dead
bird or mouse or small snake. He sprang on
it and tore it to pieces in an instant. The
moles always ate as if they were starving.
Drawing back their heads and hunching their
backs they stuffed the food into their mouths
with their clawed hands.</p>

<p>As summer passed on the young moles
began to grow discontented. They were tired
of staying at home. They were too big to
crowd upon the nest in the nursery. Whenever
two met in any of the narrow tunnels
one had to back into a side track to let the
other pass. The water was stagnant in the
wells. Food was getting more and more
scarce. Many a time there was a sound of
scratching and fighting in the long dark halls
of that underground home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon each little mole began to think of
having a home of his own, where there would
be nobody else to crowd him, or quarrel with
him, or snatch the best of everything to eat.
So presently, one by one, they wandered away
to find pleasanter places. One prowled into
a garden, and tunnelled ridges all over the
green lawn. One stumbled into a pond, but
he did not drown, for he could swim with his
webbed feet. He swam across to a small island
and dug his house under a bank where he could
catch plenty of frogs.</p>

<p>The three others strolled into a field
that had been freshly ploughed. The soil
was not wet nor hard nor stony, but just
what they liked best. Each one chose a
corner, and ran his main tunnel from end
to end of the space to be used for his
hunting-ground.</p>

<p>The five new homes were much like the old
one. Each had a domed underground room
with a nest of leaves and grasses in it, and
several outlets to allow escape in case of
danger. Each had one or more main tunnels,
with smooth-pressed sides and many zigzag
side tracks leading in all directions. Each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
had tiny wells of water, and little storerooms
for the winter supply of earthworms.</p>

<p>When winter came, and the ground was
frozen hard above, each little mole, alone by
himself, dived down into his safe deep nest
and stayed there till early spring softened the
soil. Then, livelier than ever, he shovelled his
way out to the surface to find a mate. Soon
in every pleasant little home under the ground
there was a new family of soft, round babies,
with their specks of eyes deep hidden in their
satiny gray fur.</p>

<p class="ph2">CONCLUSION</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Countless</span> years have passed since
that day, long, long ago, when the
first tiny living creature began to grow
in the new world of rocks and water. All
this time things have been moving and changing.
The earth keeps whizzing around the
sun, while the sun itself rushes blazing through
space. Brooks are rippling; rivers are flowing;
seas are rolling their waves against the
shores. Now the trees toss their branches in
the wind; now the rain sprinkles down from
gray clouds, or snow drifts silently over the
prairie.</p>

<p>In the spring all the wilderness is green
with growing leaves and flowers and grasses.
The world is alive with animals. In the water
sea creatures are feeding in their places, or
floating and swimming here and there. On
land there are worms and insects, creeping
reptiles and flying birds.</p>

<p>From inland ponds beavers scramble ashore
in the dusk to nibble fresh twigs for supper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
In southern rivers the manatee crawls over
the white sand among the reeds. On island
beaches little seals go paddling in safe pools.
Out at sea great whales glide through the
waves.</p>

<p>On the plains buffalo calves kick up their
heels near the grazing herd. Elk, with ears
twitching at every strange sound, wander
down from upland meadows. In the woods
rabbits hop away under the bushes. Little
shrews dart from leaf to leaf among the
shadows. In wilder spots pointed noses sniff
and bright eyes twinkle from the dens of
wolves and foxes. Bears shuffle softly through
the underbrush, and panthers steal out on tiptoe
to their hunting.</p>

<p>In the trees squirrels scamper from branch
to branch. Now and then a mother opossum
trots by with her pocket full of young ones.
Bats fly this way and that in hungry pursuit
of insects dancing in the twilight air. Under
the ground moles dig busily after worms.</p>

<p>All these mammals and, many others live
wild in the United States, and there are many
others still, more or less like them, in foreign
lands.</p>

agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
